Manuel signed an agreement last month admitting his misdeeds and pledging not to apply for reinstatement for at least 10 years. Patient satisfaction : a chiropractor in iowa has surrendered his license to practice and admitted to swapping services for sex and performing exorcisms on some patients. Nonetheless, he's received outstanding evaluations for patient satisfaction on healthgrades. Com. The agreement requires that manuel prove any circumstances surrounding the revocation of his license no longer exist before he can resume practicing chiropractic in the state. Those circumstances included bartering sex for services with some patients. Manuel also recommended that patients stop taking medication he prescribed to them. A woman who answered a call to manuel's home from the des moines register declined to comment on the case. A woman at his former practice said he hadn't worked there for some time.

But there was one notable absence from the patriots squad who visited on thursday, with quarterback tom brady nowhere to be seen. However, a spokesman for the patriots said `prior family commitments' were the reason why brady didn't attend the visit. Scroll down for video. President barack obama ( centre ) welcomed the new england patriots to the white house on thursday. Patriots beat seattle seahawks 28 - 24 to win super bowl xlix in february and were congratulated by obama. But there was one notable absence with quarterback tom brady nowhere to be seen at the white house. The patriots beat seattle seahawks 28 - 24 to win the nfl super bowl in glendale, arizona with brady named as mvp for the third time in his fourth super bowl victory. Although brady wasn't able to visit the white house with his team - mates, he'll be fondly remembered for his performance in the patriots' super bowl win.

Sapp was arrested the night after the super bowl in phoenix, arizona, on a prostitution charge after an alleged incident involving two women. In a police video released on monday, sapp, 42, cries, cackles and confesses about what exactly went down back on february 2 in the renaissance hotel. In the video obtained by tmz, sapp admits he paid for oral sex and that `everyone got naked' after he `put $ 600 on the table' in his hotel room.

A pioneering facial surgeon `repeatedly' punched a patient in the head in an `extraordinary' attempt to correct a fracture caused by an industrial accident, a medical tribunal has heard. Professor ninian peckitt, 63, claimed he had simply `digitally manipulated' the patient's face as part of hospital treatment, but witnesses said that in reality he had actually been hitting him, the tribunal was told. The world - renowned surgeon, who has lectured on the use of titanium implants to treat disfigured patients and has been published in academic texts, faces being struck off the medical register after being accused of failing three of his patients. A medical practitioners tribunal service hearing in manchester was told a man referred to as patient a had suffered `extensive injuries' to the right side of his face in an industrial accident. He was admitted to ipswich hospital in february 2012 where professor peckitt was working as an honorary locum consultant in oral and maxillo - facial surgery since the previous month. Christopher hamlet, representing the general medical council, told the hearing : `the case is not centred around the outcome, but the method of the surgery by way of the extraordinary allegation that he repeatedly punched the patient in the face.' He added that patient a had fallen out of bed which had further displaced his facial fractures. The hearing was told professor peckitt embarked on a `closed reduction' procedure, in which a patient is given anaesthetic before the fractured bone is manually put back together without surgery, and a cast or splint applied. Mr peckitt was working as an honorary locum at ipswich hospital in suffolk at the time of the alleged incident in february 2012. A medical tribunal will decide whether he should be struck off the register.

In november 1942, the unguarded ss city of cairo was sunk by a german u - boat while carrying 296 civilians and cargo that included 100 tons of silver. The vessel sunk to more than 16, 800 feet under the surface ( 5, 150 meters ) where it went undiscovered until 2011 when deep ocean search decided to go looking for it. The sinking was the stuff of legend. The city of cairo was bringing silver rupees from india to england as part of the war effort. After a stop in brazil, two torpedos sank the ship in the atlantic. After the ship went under, the u - boat reportedly surfaced and the captain said to the survivors in lifeboats : `` goodnight, sorry for sinking you.' ' the captain's lament is the title of a book about the event. Only a handful of people died as the ship sank but about 100 more passed away during the desperate attempt of the six boats to make it to land, which was hundreds of miles away. When the last of the lifeboats was found 51 days later, all but two people in it had died. Deep ocean search said in a news release that during the 2011 search it located an unnatural object on radar. A sub found the city of cairo split into two parts, buried by silt. ` `under contract to the uk ministry of transport, dos recovered several tens of tons of silver coins from a depth of ( 5, 150 meters ),'' the company said. The depth is a world record, the company claimed. Other deep - water operations reported in the media that are close to this depth include the 1987 search for\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe ship sank to england in 2011.\n\n",

The first utility super league leaders were without their inspirational captain, who this week announced he is to switch codes at the end of 2015, for the third successive game on good friday, but they continue to thrive without him. The rhinos had beaten wigan and catalans dragons in sinfield's absence and added castleford to that list thanks to an excellent team performance, with young winger ash handley particularly impressive up against the formidable justin carney. Leeds rhino's adam cuthbertson celebrates a try with jamie peacock ( left ). Ryan hall was sent to the sin - bin for the first time in his career in a frenetic opening but castleford failed to take advantage and it was the rhinos who struck first as joel moon scored his first try of the season. Hall made amends by extending leeds' lead and stevie ward's converted try cancelled out michael shenton's effort to give the rhinos a 16 - 6 half - time lead. There were chances aplenty at the start of the second period but brilliant defence by both sides meant there was no further addition to the score until the 63rd minute, when hall completed his double. Adam cuthbertson then crossed for a try his performance deserved and despite shenton's late second, leeds extended their unbeaten run against the tigers to six matches. Leeds rhino's joel moon scores the first try for his side during their victory. Brian mcdermott warned the rhinos to be wary of a fast start by castleford and although it was leeds who came out of the blocks quickest, the tigers were handed an early advantage when hall was sent to the sin - bin for a professional foul. Leeds youth product luke gale failed to exploit the gap in the rhino\n\nSENTENCE:\nRyan hall was sent to leeds rhino for first time in his career.\n\n",

The latest polls have the two main parties locked on around 35 per cent, pointing to another hung parliament on may 7. But while voters are saying one thing in public, britain's bookies are seeing a completely different picture in private - - with punters placing a flood of cash on the tories. Scroll down for video. While voters are saying one thing in public, britain's bookies are seeing a completely different picture in private - - with punters placing a flood of cash on the tories. Twice as many bets on who will win the most seats have been placed on the conservatives than labour, mailonline can reveal. One bookie alone has taken five bets for more than $ 10, 000 on david cameron's party to emerge with the most seats - - with not a single bet of this size on ed miliband's labour. The betting market echoes polls which have revealed that people expect mr cameron to remain prime minister - - even if they are not planning to vote for the tories themselves. With the election going down to the wire, bookies have seen a flood of political bets. Gambling industry experts told mailonline this year's general election to be the first in history with more than $ 100million placed on its outcome - - three times the amount staked in 2010.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in birmingham where extremist islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al - qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the park view brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3, 000 messages in a whatsapp group which included offensive comments about british soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier lee rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video. Park view school in birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated. It is understood the national college for teaching and leadership ( nctl ) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the islamic plot last year found evidence of anti - western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against muslims. Golden hillock school, nansen primary school, park view school - all run by the park view educational trust - oldknow academy and saltley school in birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, alston primary, was already in special measures.

And sabeen mahmud surrounded herself there with books, people, and discussions on technology, human rights and women's entrepreneurship. Introducing others to jimi hendrix, street art, and talking politics was not supposed to get her killed. But in pakistan, free speech is dangerous, and mahmud's exuberant exercise of it made her stick out nationwide. Two gunman shot her dead at point - blank range late friday after she locked up the second floor cafe in karachi for the night, police said. Mahmud died from five bullet wounds. The gunmen also shot her mother. She is in a hospital but is expected to be released on time for her daughter's funeral. Mahmud's killing broke hearts beating for non - violence and progressive values across the country. She freely said what she thought in a place where many people are too afraid to and by doing so spoke for many more people than just herself. She had become a pakistani figurehead for humanism, love and tolerance. ` `she took that torch into the dark forest and so many people followed. She really, truly was a success story of the heart,'' said close friend and bbc journalist ziad zafar. No one has claimed responsibility for her shooting, and police have not named any motive. But mahmud had just finished leading a discussion group on a topic that many want silenced, when the shots fell. In the province of baluchistan, where separatists have fought a virulent insurgency for years, people have been disappearing regularly. There have been steady allegations of mass abduction. The lahore university of management sciences planned to host the discussion on the topic, with human rights activist mama qadeer baloch, but authorities shut it down.

The arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 1, 056 matches since his appointment in september 1996, has lifted the lid on his pre - match rituals in an interview with the official arsenal magazine. Wenger said :' i always have eight or nine players of my team in my head the day before the game, but there's always a doubt on one or two. Arsene wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his arsenal team. Wenger lifts the fa cup following arsenal's triumph over hull city at wembley last season. ` you try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. ` when two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference.' I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then i make my decision.' But even though the frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after arsenal's fa cup win last season. Wenger said : `anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line - up will be. ` you live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day. ` if you don't know on friday night, you will not know on saturday morning\n\nSENTENCE:\nArsene wenger has revealed he only makes the final decision on the morning of the match - and agonises over the selection all week.\n\n",

Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the qingming festival - - which means `pure brightness' - - china celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says people's daily online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the `yellow emperor' huangdi in huangling county, shaanxi province. Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the qingming festival which sees the chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations. Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday. Around 1. 3 billion chinese people marked the qingming festival, a three - day holiday in china, by watching parades and travelling home. Traditional chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of huangi. An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone. In shaanxi province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the qingming festival and in honour of the `yellow emperor' huang di, considered the founding father of the chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of china's provinces including hong kong, macao, and taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of april every year, and is one of the 24 chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds. Hundreds of visitors filmed the celebrations on their smart phones, as a colourful inflatable dragon dances in\n\nSENTENCE:\nAround 1.3 billion chinese people marked the qingming festival, a three-day holiday in china.\n\n",

Around 1. 3 billion chinese people marked the qingming festival, a three - day holiday in china, by watching parades and travelling home.

Why i fled : migrants share their stories. The smuggler took her to an unfinished building on the outskirts of tripoli near the city's many ports, where the migrants they have already found are kept until the crossing is ready. The building could only be reached by walking down a trash - littered alleyway, and featured a series of packed rooms, separated by curtains, where dozens sat - - well over the 80 migrants she was promised would be in her boat. The smuggler explained that the `` final price'' for syrians - - often thought to be richer than their african migrant counterparts - - was $ 1, 000.

In a case that was condemned around the world, luo kun kun was expelled from his village when locals - including his own grandfather - signed a petition to banish him to `protect villagers' health'. Following that cold - hearted decision, the mournful child explained how, `nobody plays with me, i play alone'. But now a specialist school in linfen, a city in southern shanxi province, has stepped in to help. The red ribbon school is the only school in china equipped to look after and educate hiv - positive children. Kun kun was refused admission to schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. The five - year - old has now been admitted a place at the red ribbon school in linfen, china,. After being banished from his village, kun kun finally has a home where he is cared for and looked after. Kun kun contracted the virus from his mother when she was pregnant with him, but was only diagnosed when he was five years old.

The boy was refused admission to local schools and locals would avoid contact with him, so he spent his days playing in the woods alone. When he was diagnosed, his grandparents found themselves isolated in their village of shufangya in south - eastern china's sichuan province and so sided with the locals. At a special meeting on december 7 last year, 203 village residents signed a petition asking the authorities to `carry out preventative isolation measures by taking kun kun away from the village, and protect the health of the villagers and children'.

The horrific incident happened after lisa and james tuttle moved with their five children to the rural village of geldeston in norfolk in 2005. They thought their big house with a large garden surrounded by arable land would be a peaceful and idyllic family home. But their happiness was shattered in 2014 after their dogs marley and lily were shot after escaping on to their neighbour's farmland where they were accused of killing his birds. Scroll down for video. Lisa tuttle with her one remaining dog bella, after her other two dogs were shot dead by the farmer next door. Lily, centre, and marley, right, were killed as they were accused of slaughtering a farmer's birds after escaping onto his land from the tuttle's garden. Bella, left, is the family's remaining dog. Lisa reveals on channel 5 show the nightmare neighbour next door how she had a long - running dispute with the owner of the farm, john cook, over her dogs trespassing on his property. It began with their first dog - a labrador called ruby - who the family got shortly after moving into their new home. Lisa said ruby kept escaping from their garden onto mr cook's land causing him to come and complain. She explained : `he knocked on the door and said `` your dog is getting out, she's being a problem, she's going after my pheasants''.' ' i didn't like him, i thought he was rude. I was upset as i didn't want to cause trouble. We did our best to make sure it wouldn't happen again and i thought that would be the end of it.' But a few days later, mr cook returned to complain that ruby had killed 120 of his birds and if he saw her on his land again, he would shoot her.

A mother - of - five has been convicted of killing her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper and hiding her body in a suitcase. Claudia martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends. Paramedics were called after the 33 - year - old, a portuguese national, was found sitting in the bath with' a lot of blood' and she was taken to hospital. Earlier she had killed the infant by stuffing toilet paper down its throat. She then wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it lay undiscovered for three days. Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. During her trial at bristol crown court the jury was told she gave birth alone at her sister's flat in knowle, bristol on september 12 last year. Adam vaitilingam qc, prosecuting, said : `she told no - one of her pregnancy and gave birth in as secretive a way as she could, for someone living in a crowded flat, and kept the fact of that birth secret from all those around her and closest to her, including her sister. ` she placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. ` no doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Two days later, her sister vilma raised the alarm after noticing a smell coming from a suitcase in the defendant's bedroom. Police were called to the flat and discovered the body of a newborn baby inside martins' small, black suitcase, on september 15. Martins, described as having an extremely low iq, was arrested and admitted she had given birth but said the baby was stillborn.\n\nSENTENCE:\nClaudia martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends.\n\n",

Shorter's pregnant wife joanne, who is expecting his child in six weeks, and other members of his family watched from the public gallery as the charges against him were read out. But judge noel lucas ruled that shorter could not be sentenced until a victim impact statement had been taken from the girl to find out how his crimes had affected her. The pair met because shorter was her maths teacher at the school, which counts convicted sex offender max clifford.

The research, carried out in milan, backs up tests carried out by the charity medical detection dogs. Its co - founder dr claire guest said the charity's research found a 93 per cent reliability rate when detecting both prostate and bladder cancer. She hailed the new study, describing the findings as `spectacular'. Dogs have been found to detect prostate cancer with 98 per cent accuracy when sniffing men's urine samples. The latest research, by the department of urology at the humanitas clinical and research centre in milan, involved two dogs sniffing the urine of 900 men - 360 with prostate cancer and 540 without. Scientists found that dog one got it right in 98. 7 per cent of cases, while for dog two this was 97. 6 per cent. They said the dogs are able to detect prostate cancer specific volatile organic compounds in the urine but said an important question remains of how a dog would find it in daily practice. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the uk, with more than 40, 000 new cases diagnosed every year. Dr guest said : `these results are spectacular. They offer us further proof that dogs have the ability to detect human cancer. ` it is particularly exciting that we have such a high success rate in the detection of prostate cancer, for which the existing tests are woefully inadequate.' She said there is currently a `reluctance to embrace this tested, time - old technology' but dogs can pick up a scent in a dilution of one to a thousand parts.

Wished you could place it on the other side of the room, but not had the plug socket needed? Well, your mood - lighting dreams are about to come true. Philips has unveiled its latest foray into smart lighting which, thanks to its wireless and rechargeable features, can be moved wherever you want in your home. The dome - like hue go can be controlled wirelessly from any ios or android device via the philips hue app or any app developed for the lamp. Scroll down for video. Bowl of sunshine : the lamp uses a rechargeable battery and offers three hours of continuous light. When connected to the `bridge', hue go can also be synced to music for a disco effect, as well as to television programmes, films and video games to create more of an atmosphere depending on the mood. The bridge is what links the app to the hi - tech bulbs. Linked to wi - fi, it can connect up to 50 bulbs at a time. The bridge also connects a system to the wider world. With it a user can control lights remotely to ward off burglars, for example. Mood lighting : the button has seven preset light settings : warm white light, cool daylight, and what philips describe as `five natural dynamic effects' that enhance moments such as meditation ( pictured ). Wakey wakey! The dome - shaped lamp can also be used as a sleep aid and an alarm clock. It gradually dims or increases light intensity to gently encourage sleep or waking. The bowl - shaped lamp uses a rechargeable li - ion battery and offers up to three hours of continuous light after a 90 - minute charge. Rechargeable non - - replaceable li - ion battery. Up to 3 hours of light after a 90 - minute charge. All shades of white, from warm to cold colour temperatures. 16 million colors. 5 dynamic\n\nSENTENCE:\nWith it a user can control lights remotely to ward off burglars.\n\n",

But the probe hasn't finished its mission yet, with new, detailed views emerging of the planet as messenger spirals closer to its surface. Now nasa has released an image taken by the probe's visual and infrared spectrometer ( virs ) revealing distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters. Nasa has released an image taken by the probe's visual and infrared spectrometer ( virs ) to reveal distinct features such as volcanic vents and fresh craters. To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the mercury dual imaging system ( mdis ). To highlight the geological features, the images have been overlain on a black and white mosaic from the mercury dual imaging system ( mdis ). This is an instrument with wide - and narrow - angle cameras that has been mapping the rugged landforms on mercury's surface. The spacecraft is expected to smash into the planet's surface at 2. 4 miles per second ( 3. 9 km / s ). The event will take place on thursday 30 april at 3 : 30 pm eastern time ( 7. 30 pm gmt ). However, when it does, messenger will be behind mercury, and hidden from earth. ` the last couple of hours will probably be pretty quiet,' mercury mission head sean solomon told nature. ` there will be a final orbit when the spacecraft passes behind the planet and we won't hear from it again.' I have worked on the mission for 19 years. It's like losing a member of the family. Even pre - knowledge doesn't prepare you completely for the loss.' The mercury dual imaging system\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe event will take place on thursday 30 april after a four-year mission.\n\n",

Brendan rodgers has killed off lambert's career and you've got to feel sorry for the player. You can't blame him for joining liverpool - - why would he turn that down? At the time he was a confident striker - - playing regularly in the premier league and scoring goals for southampton. He'd just been to a world cup. Rickie lambert has scarcely been given a chance since joining liverpool despite their striking problems. Brendan rodgers' decision to ignore lambert, in favour of mario balotelli, is completely illogical. This time last year lambert was about to play at a world cup for england but his stock has fallen since. For rodgers to ignore him when they have desperately needed goals is illogical. I'm well aware lambert isn't luis suarez, i know he's not a world - class striker. Lambert missed out on saturday at west brom because of a hip injury but it must have been gutting for him to see mario balotelli get yet another chance. The england striker played 90 minutes 20 times last season, made 31 starts, and unlike any liverpool player in the scoring charts this season, easily got into double figures. Contrast that with this campaign when in terms of premier league minutes on the pitch lambert has played the equivalent of roughly six - and - a - half games. Lambert has enjoyed the opportunity to score for his boyhood team but he deserves more football. When he has started in the premier league or champions league, lambert and liverpool have impressed. On his first premier league start for liverpool he scored, and when he played 90 minutes in four consecutive games he scored in the first game, liverpool won the next two, and drew the fourth. And then he was dropped again and hasn't started since. Meanwhile, balotelli regularly gets more time on the pitch, and regularly fails to deliver.

The first minister was forced to admit her mps would vote for fiscal autonomy as early as next year, despite the catastrophic collapse in north sea oil revenues. Such a move would leave a massive $ 7. 6 billion black hole in scotland's finances, triggering either higher taxes, deeper spending cuts or unsustainable borrowing levels. Nicola sturgeon said she would back calls for all tax powers to be devolved to scotland `as soon as possible', but labour leader jim murphy ( right ) warned this would leave a catastrophic hole in the country's budget. Miss sturgeon struggled once again in a tv election clash screened by the bbc, just a day after she faced an audience backlash by refusing to rule out a snap second referendum on independence. She walked into a trap set by labour leader jim murphy, who pointed out that one of the snp's biggest supporters, billionaire jim mccoll, admitted scotland is not ready for fiscal autonomy. But asked when she wants full tax powers, miss sturgeon said `as soon as possible'. ` as scotland's voice in the house of commons, if the snp is there in numbers we will be arguing for as many powers to come to scotland as quickly as possible,' she said.' I would like it as quickly as the other parties agree to give it.' Asked by murphy `would your mps vote for it next year?' , the first minister replied :' i would vote for it, would you support it?' To applause, the labour leader swiftly responded : `no i wouldn't. ` absolutely not, and let me tell you why. This is the idea that we cut ourselves off from sources of taxation across the uk.

The number of gps from abroad is up by 11 per cent in a decade as the nhs tries to combat a shortage of staff. Foreigners now account for almost one family doctor in five although in some areas the proportion is more than two - thirds. Senior doctors say the number will rise further over the next few years because the nhs is so short of homegrown medics. Figures from the health and social care information centre show that 22. 0 per cent of current gps gained their qualifications overseas, up from 19. 8 per cent in 2004. But the figure is 71 per cent in barking and dagenham, east london, 63 per cent in medway, kent, and 58 per cent in north lincolnshire. The nhs is facing a shortage because many gps are retiring early. Others are moving overseas in search of better conditions. The royal college of gps estimates that the nhs will need to hire at least 8, 000 more doctors over the next five years to keep pace with a rising, and ageing, population. The nhs employs 40, 584 gps, of whom 8, 941 are from overseas. This is up from 6, 921 in 2004 when there were 34, 855 family doctors in total. Dr richard vautrey, deputy chairman of the british medical association's gp committee, said : `we need gps from around the world to support the health service, and we simply don't train enough. ` we need to encourage more students and junior doctors to choose general practice, and to expose them more to general practice, so they see it more as an attractive option for the future.'

I thought today might be a little easier than yesterday having played a round with the lead but it wasn't. I didn't sleep well last night, just got out here and got in a bit of rhythm and we were off. With two major champions behind i couldn't let up. ` it's the most incredible week of my life. This is as great as it gets in our sport, this is a dream come true for me. To shoot some low rounds and to see some putts go in out here and to hear those roars, it was remarkable.' Spieth was greeted by his family at the 18th green, with his father telling him to do a lap of honour for all the patrons round the 18th green.

Regardless of the state of the wicket, root was in superb touch on his way to 182 not out in the morning session, his second highest score and the fourth of his six hundreds to pass the 150 mark.

Root's efforts left the west indies with a 165 - run deficit, but they cleared that to finish 37 ahead on 202 for two at stumps. Speaking after the match, root lifted the lid on the tourists' frustrations. ` these pitches are great for batters because we get big scores but as far as test cricket is concerned, it's not ideal,' he said. ` unfortunately, it's a very unresponsive pitch and it's been hard work. ` we all thought it might break up a little bit more and give a little bit more spin than it has done, but unfortunately it hasn't happened. ` this is what we've got to deal with, and we've just got to get on the best we can.'

The transport workers' union's national secretary tony sheldon condemned the requested change to the fair work act and accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. ` major retailers like aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' mr sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to workplace relations productivity commission. ` their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part - time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National secretary of the transport workers' union, tony sheldon, accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the workplace relations productivity commission, in which it recommended that the national employment standards be amended to `enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees `overwhelmingly supported' and `preferred' the proposals. ` aldi's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' david zalunardo, aldi's managing director, wrote. However mr sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to `strip workers of their rights'. ` the transport workers' union and its members acted against this billion - dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said. Mr sheldon responded by saying : `aldi.\n\nSENTENCE:\nNational secretary of the transport workers' union has condemned the requested change to the fair work act and accused aldi of trying to gain the right to force employees to work more than 38 hours a week.\n\n",

National secretary of the transport workers' union, tony sheldon, accused aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the workplace relations productivity commission, in which it recommended that the national employment standards be amended to `enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees `overwhelmingly supported' and `preferred' the proposals. ` aldi's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' david zalunardo, aldi's managing director, wrote. However mr sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to `strip workers of their rights'. ` the transport workers' union and its members acted against this billion - dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said.

The trip was highly anticipated. After all, this was to have been kim's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father's death, and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery. But this week, russia announced that the trip had been canceled, with kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov saying thursday that moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen. He said that `` the decision is connected with north korean domestic affairs.' ' what could have changed kim's mind? It is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty, but a possible explanation is that kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position. And nervous dictators prefer to stay home. True, kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on earth. And there is unceasing public praise for the younger `dear leader,'' including frenzied eruptions of support. But these eruptions are carefully scripted, and those who have managed to flee the north confirm that in private, many are unhappy with the regime. Perhaps with the potential threats in mind, kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power. In 2013, kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle, jang song thaek, who had stood by his side from the day his father died. Jang had mentored and guided the young kim as he took the reins, but the once - powerful jang was arrested by soldiers during a politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on\n\nSENTENCE:\nNorth korea's ruler was expected to join moscow on the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii.\n\n",

According to a wall street journal report thursday, chinese nuclear experts have told the united states that pyongyang may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads. And while that number may seem stunning, it is actually only part of a troubling story. The key takeaway from the latest assessment of north korea's nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads, but the type of warhead, as this gives a better clue to the future of the country's weapons capabilities. True, the reported chinese estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear `` arsenal.' ' however, this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by u. S. And other experts. The big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that north korea could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium. If that assessment is correct, and pyongyang can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium, then the plutonium program that the u. S. And members of the six - party talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial.

As he drew closer to the bus, barnett decided to stop filming because he didn't know what to expect. ` `it was shocking,'' he said. ` `i didn't know what i was about to see. I didn't know if anyone was hurt.' ' barnett said he didn't realize at the time that the bus belonged to the country band. Hillary scott, co - lead singer for the band, posted a photo of the charred bus on instagram and noted that she, her husband, the tour manager and the driver were all evacuated safely. ` `thanking god for our safety and the safety of all of those who helped put this fire out and keep us safe,'' she wrote. The tour manager told cnn affiliate ktvt that the bus stopped after a rear tire blew out. It burst into flames after everyone had gotten off. Scott also posted an instagram photo and message saying that the fire destroyed everything in the bus's back lounge except her bible. The band's two other members, charles kelley and dave haywood, were not traveling on the bus, ktvt reported. Lady antebellum is set to perform at the 50th academy of country music awards on sunday in arlington, texas.\n\nSENTENCE:\n`` it was shocking,'' barnett said.\n\n",

A million people will be able to realise the dream of home ownership by 2020, david cameron claimed today as he donned hi - vis to tour a building site. The prime minister said seven key tory policies would help get people on to the property ladder by building more homes and cutting the cost of saving for a deposit, moving house and paying off mortgages. The tory leader, wearing notably clean new work boots, as he chatted to house builders, insisted `dream of home ownership is alive'. Mr cameron used the launch of the conservative party manifesto yesterday to promise voters `security at every stage of your life'. He said the `greatest sunshine that there can possibly be' included helping more people but their own home, as well as getting a job and having dignity in retirement. Today the tory leader set out a seven point plan which he claims will help build more houses and making it easier for first - time buyers, claiming it will help a million people become homeowners over the next parliament. Mr cameron said : `the conservative party is the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your lives. ` at the heart of that is helping people onto the housing ladder.

A million people will be able to realise the dream of home ownership by 2020, david cameron claimed today as he donned hi - vis to tour a building site. The prime minister said seven key tory policies would help get people on to the property ladder by building more homes and cutting the cost of saving for a deposit, moving house and paying off mortgages. The tory leader, wearing notably clean new work boots, as he chatted to house builders, insisted `dream of home ownership is alive'. Mr cameron used the launch of the conservative party manifesto yesterday to promise voters `security at every stage of your life'. He said the `greatest sunshine that there can possibly be' included helping more people but their own home, as well as getting a job and having dignity in retirement. Today the tory leader set out a seven point plan which he claims will help build more houses and making it easier for first - time buyers, claiming it will help a million people become homeowners over the next parliament. Mr cameron said : `the conservative party is the party of working people, offering you security at every stage of your lives. ` at the heart of that is helping people onto the housing ladder. It comes back to our values. We believe if you work hard, save up, and do the right thing, you should be able to buy your own place. ` the plans in our manifesto will open home ownership to a million more people. With us, the dream of home ownership is alive. ` and it's why we can look the working people of britain in the eye and say we are with you. That's why we are setting out a seven point plan to help build more houses, and help more people get a home of their own.' The seven point plan includes the help to buy isa, announced by george osborne\n\nSENTENCE:\nHe said it will help a million people over parliament.\n\n",

Yazidi girls who slipped isis after its siege of mount sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for isis fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by human rights watch found `` a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by isis forces,'' actions that the group says `` are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity.'

The kennel club says seemingly harmless foods such as hot cross buns and onions can be killers - - and is urging owners to be alert to the threat. Around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning between 2010 and 2014, according to figures compiled by the charity and the veterinary poisons information service. Of those, 470 dogs died. Sick : around 56, 000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014. Unlike crufts prizewinner jagger the irish setter, who died last month after eating meat laced with poison, most poisoned pets will simply have eaten something they found lying around the home or fallen ill after being fed treats by their well - meaning owners. Painkillers were the most common cause of poisoning, followed by rat and mouse bait and chocolate - - which can cause sickness, diarrhoea and fits and trigger heart problems. Dark chocolate is particularly toxic. Foods such as sultanas, grapes and raisins are also highly dangerous for dogs, causing canine kidneys to fail. Dried forms of the fruit found in cakes are the most toxic. Onions, garlic and leeks can cause life - threatening anaemia. Nick sutton, a kennel club poisons expert, said : `there are any number of ways a dog can get access to dangerous and potentially lethal substances, whether by accident, deliberate feeding or through owners mistakenly believing certain products - - particularly foods eaten by humans - - are fine for a dog to eat. ` many seemingly harmless foods can be dangerous for a dog and owners need to be aware of these risks in order to protect their much - loved pets.' The popularity of e - cigarettes has seen them feature more prominently among poisoning cases, with 64 dogs taken to the vet in 2014 after chewing the nicotine - rich refills - - an increase of 300 per cent.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAround 56,000 dogs were treated for poisoning by vets between 2010 and 2014.\n\n",

Jonny bucknell, 58, was enjoying his meal in the council chamber when a labour rival, theo blackwell, spotted him and alerted other councillors. He was forced to put down his cutlery when the mayor, lazzaro pietragnoli, interrupted the proceedings to tell him off. Taking a stand : jonny bucknell is no stranger to odd behaviour. In 2013 he slept in his car at the tory party conference. He now says he wants a rule change so he can eat a roast dinner at council meetings. The mayor, who was chairing the meeting of camden council in north london, reminded the hungry councillor that eating was banned in the chamber. But the angry diner claims he was unaware eating there was forbidden and said he now aims to campaign for a rule change. The rumpus comes a month after liberal democrat councillor martin elengorn was caught playing scrabble during a richmond council budget meeting in south - west london. Telling off : mayor of camden council, lazzaro pietragnoli, had to tell mr bucknell to stop eating. When he first noticed him eating, mr blackwell told his fellow councillors : `it appears that one of our tory colleagues is consuming a full sunday roast dinner in the council chamber. ` could i ask the borough solicitor to give us advice on eating a full roast dinner in the council chamber? It's a little bit more than a cheeky snickers.' The diner was forced to curtail his meal. Mr bucknell, who has been a councillor for more than ten years and represents belsize, hampstead, told the evening standard :' i never knew there was a ban on eating in the chamber. ` they should definitely repeal it.

The union eventually backed down after a backlash from students, one of whom described the exclusive policy as `patronising beyond belief'.

Both clubs have until thursday to respond to the charge. Reading fans invaded the pitch after the fa cup quarter - final replay against bradford at madejski stadium.

Seats were also thrown from the stand holding west brom's supporters and some baggies players were confronted by celebrating fans. West brom expressed their `deep concern' for the safety of the players after the match and manager tony pulis described the scenes as `disgraceful'. A shirtless man hangs from the crossbar after villa beat the baggies in the fa cup quarter - final. Hundreds of villa fans celebrated victory over their local rivals by storming onto the pitch.

A gunman has killed four people - including a judge and a witness - after going on a rampage at a milan court where he was due to appear today accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. The defendant, claudio giardiello, 46, is said to have first killed his lawyer lorenzo alberto claris appiani, 37, and his co - defendant before shooting dead judge fernando ciampi in an act of revenge `against those that ruined me'. Prosecutors said the attack was carried out with `cold premeditation'. A fourth victim, understood to have been a witness, had no visible injuries and is thought to have died of a heart attack. Several other people suffered serious injuries in the attack, including giardiello's former colleagues and accountant.

Giardiello likely used a false id pass to enter the court through a side door reserved for judges and lawyers, who are not obliged to have their belongings scanned by a metal detector, milan public prosecutor edmondo bruto liberati said. Prime minister matteo renzi said the attack' a moment of great pain, of sadness' adding that it was `unthinkable someone should be able to enter a court with a weapon.' He promised `the government will shed the utmost light on the event' and described the police who had chased down and arrested the man as heroic. The gunman's attack began when he fired four or five rounds from multiple weapons at 11am.

A gunman has killed four people - including a judge and a witness - after going on a rampage at a milan court where he was due to appear today accused of fraudulent bankruptcy. The defendant, claudio giardiello, 46, is said to have first killed his lawyer lorenzo alberto claris appiani, 37, and his co - defendant before shooting dead judge fernando ciampi in an act of revenge `against those that ruined me'. Prosecutors said the attack was carried out with `cold premeditation'. A fourth victim, understood to have been a witness, had no visible injuries and is thought to have died of a heart attack. Several other people suffered serious injuries in the attack, including giardiello's former colleagues and accountant. After his killing spree, the gunman managed to evade police and fled the courthouse on his motorbike, reaching the town of vimercate 15 miles from milan before being arrested. Giardiello likely used a false id pass to enter the court through a side door reserved for judges and lawyers, who are not obliged to have their belongings scanned by a metal detector, milan public prosecutor edmondo bruto liberati said.

French health chiefs say the uk is responsible for causing a sharp rise in the number of youngsters who binge - drink. It has slammed the practice of going out to get drunk as an `anglo - saxon phenomenon' and says it is being copied by increasing numbers of youths on the continent. But critics have said it's a case of double standards for a country where children are encouraged to drink wine at the table from a relatively early age. The latest figures reveal that almost half of french 18 to 25 years olds have consumed alcohol with the sole aim of getting drunk - - compared to 33 per cent ten years ago. The rise in binging is particularly high among young women, soaring from eight per cent who admitted they had done it in 2005, to three times that number by 2015. Now france's state health watchdog has claimed the sharp increase is due to french youths copying the english. Francis bourdillon, head of the national institute of prevention and health education, said : `this is an anglo - saxon phenomenon that's starting to creep into the generation of the 15 - 24 - year - olds. ` consumption of alcohol in france is particularly worrying among young people and especially among young women. ` besides the obvious health concerns, binge drinking can also lead to violence against women, sometimes fatal drunken accidents, and unprotected sex.'

Kris wardle, who lives in leicester, thought his world was complete when he married his long - term girlfriend katrina in 2011 with her teenage son, mark, acting as best man. However, less than two years later, the hgv truck driver would be a widower, after his beloved wife was killed in a frenzied knife attack by now 21 - year - old mark after a row over his cannabis use.

Jayson mcdonald was found hiding under a bed in amsterdam in the netherlands, while paul monk was captured at his luxury villa in the holiday hotspot of alicante on the spanish coast. They were arrested as part of operation captura, a drive launched in 2006 by the national crime agency, crimestoppers and spanish authorities to catch suspects who had fled from the uk. Jayson mcdonald ( right ) is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a europe - wide organised crime network. Paul monk ( left ) was wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. Monk, 54, from romford in essex was overseeing workmen laying a marble patio around his swimming pool when armed police swooped at the address where an imitation firearm with silencer and 125, 000 euro were recovered. On wednesday morning mcdonald, aged 37, from acton, west london, was apprehended as part of a separate joint investigation with the dutch national police. Mcdonald had been hiding in spain but it is believed he based himself in the netherlands after officers raided a property where he was living in the coin area of malaga last month. He is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a europe - wide organised crime network responsible for the importation of class a drugs into the uk.

Jayson mcdonald was found hiding under a bed in amsterdam in the netherlands, while paul monk was captured at his luxury villa in the holiday hotspot of alicante on the spanish coast. They were arrested as part of operation captura, a drive launched in 2006 by the national crime agency, crimestoppers and spanish authorities to catch suspects who had fled from the uk. Jayson mcdonald ( right ) is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a europe - wide organised crime network. Paul monk ( left ) was wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. Monk, 54, from romford in essex was overseeing workmen laying a marble patio around his swimming pool when armed police swooped at the address where an imitation firearm with silencer and 125, 000 euro were recovered. On wednesday morning mcdonald, aged 37, from acton, west london, was apprehended as part of a separate joint investigation with the dutch national police. Mcdonald had been hiding in spain but it is believed he based himself in the netherlands after officers raided a property where he was living in the coin area of malaga last month. He is wanted on suspicion of conspiracies to import and supply heroin and cocaine, and is believed to be a member of a europe - wide organised crime network responsible for the importation of class a drugs into the uk. Monk is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine and conspiracy to supply cannabis. He was allegedly involved in the handover of a kilo of cocaine in cockfosters, north london, in may 2013. He is also linked to the seizure of 23 kilos of herbal cannabis and one kilo of cannabis resin\n\nSENTENCE:\nMonk is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cannabis.\n\n",

A serial pedophile in florida has been arrested for molesting at least seven young children in his apartment complex just 18 months after he was released from prison by officials who voted to give him a second chance. Michael shepard, 35, conned parents into letting him babysit their kids and was frequently seen riding around the neighborhood with children on his scooter, authorities say. When asked about the sex offender notification he gave to his neighbors, he claimed that he had been in prison for a `romeo and juliet romance' with a preacher's daughter. Police now say he did everything he could to win the confidence of the parents at cedar hollow apartments in pinellas park so that he could prey on their children. He is accused of horrific sexual attacks on seven children, both boys and girls. His youngest alleged victim is five years old. All of them were age 12 or younger. Detectives say he tempted them with video games, candy and trips to mcdonald's. He also drove young children to his `hideout' in the woods where he allegedly forced them to perform sexual acts on him and raped them. Parents even let their children sleep over at his apartment. The tampa bay times reports that shepard, who has a history of molesting children dating back 20 years, served 15 years in prison for molesting two boys, age six and nine, at a roller rink in 1998. As his term in prison neared its end, authorities filed petitions to keep him locked up under the jimmy ryce act, a florida law that allows sex offenders to be kept behind bars past their sentences if they're likely to re - offend. Shepard posted these sex offender notifications around his apartment complex, but told parents he was convicted of sleeping with a preacher's teenage daughter. Parents soon began to trust shepard and even let him babysit their kids, authorities say. Two psychologists examined shepard\n\nSENTENCE:\nMichael shepard, 35, was released from prison by officials who voted to give him a second chance.\n\n",

Liverpool's manager had already gone cold on the italian, concluding some time ago that he has no future at anfield. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warnings about balotelli. He knew jose mourinho considered him `unmanageable' and he listened to the anecdotal evidence he received from the members of his staff who had encountered the troublesome striker during their time at manchester city. But rodgers rather hoped balotelli might be maturing with age, and he made the mistake of thinking he could succeed where others had failed in actually getting through to him. Mario balotelli has no future at liverpool after manager brendan rodgers lost patience with the striker. Rodgers will admit he ignored the warning signs but had hoped balotelli was maturing as he got older. Balotelli shared an image of a thermometer reading to prove he was too ill to play against blackburn. Liverpool's manager was desperate too, of course. Attempts to recruit other strikers, in particular alexis sanchez, had proved unsuccessful last summer and he was concerned that rickie lambert would not provide ample cover in a champions league season if daniel sturridge suffered further injury problems. He was right to worry about sturridge's physical fragility but wrong, he would probably now concede, to spend $ 16million on balotelli. For three hours in his office at melwood he attempted to lessen the risk before asking his employers to part with the money.

Bali nine member myuran sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self - portrait, showing a bullet through his heart. The painting is a self - portrait of sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart.

The date - april 29 - became official when a local funeral director in cilacap, the nearest port to nusakambangan, or death island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005.

His final request comes as images from nusakambangan showed a haunting self portrait painted by sukumaran in his cell, depicting the artist shot through the heart. His brother, chinthu sukumaran has pleaded with the indonesian president to call off the firing squad while sukumaran's lawyer was pictured removing the morbid paintings from the death row inmate's cell. Sukumaran's fellow death row inmate, andrew chan, has requested to spend his last hours in church with his family. Scroll down for video. Bali nine member myuran sukumaran has requested to spend his final days painting. He painted this self - portrait, showing a bullet through his heart. The painting is a self - portrait of sukumaran with a bullet hole through his heart. It comes after it was confirmed that australians andrew chan and sukumaran will be executed just after the stroke of midnight on wednesday ( 3am aest ). The date - april 29 - became official when a local funeral director in cilacap, the nearest port to nusakambangan, or death island, was instructed to inscribe the names of those to be shot by firing squad and the date of their deaths. Sukumaran only began painting when he was arrested and sent to prison in 2005. His skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well - known australian artist ben quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Andrew chan ( left ) and myuran sukumaran ( right ) have both been condemned to death on just past the stroke of midnight on wednesday.

The 75 - year - old man reportedly believes he accidentally stood on the saltwater crocodile while looking from his golf ball near the 11th hole at the palmer sea reef golf course at port douglas in far north queensland. The elderly man drove himself back to the clubhouse in a buggy after the 1. 2 metre reptile `nipped' him, according to the courier mail. The victim received a deep laceration to his shin and puncture wounds to his calf. The 70 - year - old man was playing golf on monday at the palmer sea reef golf course, owned by clive palmer. Palmer united party leader clive palmer, who owns the golf course, gave the victim some potentially unwelcome advice on how to avoid a similar injury in future. ` `i'd advise people not to step on crocodiles,'' he said. ` `i suppose you can understand how it would respond to having someone step on its back.' ' he also took to his twitter account following the incident to send his well wishes to the injured man.' I would like to wish the well - known local man who was attacked by a crocodile in port douglas this afternoon a speedy recovery,' mr palmer tweeted. But hours later, the billionaire posted a bizarre joke : `crocodile has been removed from all menus at palmer properties following today's incident with a member of our port douglas golf course.' The tweets followed after emergency services were called to the course after reports of a man being bitten on the leg shortly after 4pm. A queensland ambulance service spokeswoman told daily mail australia the man suffered puncture wounds on his left calf. The man, who was a member at the golf course, was treated by paramedics at the scene before he was taken to mossman district hospital in a stable condition.

Tennis champion novak djokovic issued an apology to a ball boy he frightened during the miami open. Djokovic shouted at his backroom team when the ball boy got caught up in the cross fire. Djokovic grabbed a towel from the ball boy, pictured, who seemed startled by the loud confrontation. However, following his victory, djokovic posted a message on his facebook page apologising to the youngster and his parents. He said : `it's probably been the best start to a season aside from 2011 that i had in my career, and i can't be more grateful for all the support i'm getting from you guys and i'm enjoying my time playing and competing and hopefully i brought a smile to your faces. ` also i want to reflect on a bad moment that happened in the final against andy when i lost the second set. I yelled to my camp and my box in frustration.' I saw the replay. Unfortunately a ball boy was in the middle of it and i really, really feel sorry and regret that he was there. There was absolutely no intention whatsoever to hurt him or scare him in any kind of way. I sincerely hope he forgives me. I really apologise.'

While johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in america for one simple reason : johnson was black - - and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in america : black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit bert sugar put it, `this was the white man's crown. ( to white america ), it was as if the white man's slave had become his master.' After beating tommy burns in 1908, jack johnson became the first ever black world heavyweight champion. It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as the new york times, were openly hostile to the giant texan. It mattered little that johnson was american. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white america to find a white challenger - - a `great white hope' - - who could unseat the new champion. But little did white america know that it would take over six years before johnson would be defeated, on april 5, 1915, 100 years ago on sunday. Most had believed johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion stanley ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock johnson down. Yet johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of ketchel's teeth in the process. Attention immediately turned to finding another `white hope'.

While johnson's victory wouldn't raise an eyebrow nowadays, it caused consternation in america for one simple reason : johnson was black - - and a black man had never held sport's greatest prize. Racism was rife in america : black people were not supposed to rule over whites in any sphere of life. As the great boxing pundit bert sugar put it, `this was the white man's crown.

It is difficult to convey to a reader in 2015 the shockwaves that johnson's victory caused. Even liberal newspapers, such as the new york times, were openly hostile to the giant texan. It mattered little that johnson was american. His skin was deemed the wrong colour and a great cry went up from white america to find a white challenger - - a `great white hope' - - who could unseat the new champion. But little did white america know that it would take over six years before johnson would be defeated, on april 5, 1915, 100 years ago on sunday. Most had believed johnson would be dispatched quickly. However, he made short work of his first four title defences, his most notable victory coming over world middleweight champion stanley ketchel who made the massive step up in weight and even managed to knock johnson down. Yet johnson had been fighting in second gear until that point and, as soon as he returned to his feet, scored a brutal knockout, uprooting several of ketchel's teeth in the process.

Lorenzo simon, 34, of smethwick, west midlands, and his girlfriend michelle bird used their friend michael spalding for slave labour before simon killed him and dismembered his body. The 39 - year - old's remains were stuffed into two suitcases before simon and bird threw them into birmingham canal, a court heard. Scroll down for video. Lorenzo simon, ( left ) who killed michael spalding ( right ) before stuffing the body in a suitcase and throwing it into a canal, has been jailed for a minimum of 19 years. Police have now released cctv video footage showing the pair dragging the cases along a pavement. Simon was found guilty of murder at birmingham crown court today and bird, while being acquitted of the same charge, was convicted of assisting an offender and sentenced to two and a half years. At a sentencing hearing, mrs justice thirlwall told simon : `you had no thought for him at all. Your focus, as so often in your life, was on what was best for you.'

For many, the glorious sunshine and promise of temperatures warmer than the mediterranean this week will come as a welcome relief. But for millions, the first tentative steps towards summer brings impending misery as a dreaded cloud of invisible pollen descends. Experts told mailonline that five million people are expected to fall victim to the symptoms - which include streaming eyes, incessant sneezing and irritating itches at the back of the throat - for the first time. Around 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year, experts told mailonline. And by 2030 that figure is expected to surge to 31. 8 million sufferers. Dr jean emberlin, a leading pollen expert, told mailonline that a 33 per cent rise in the number of people struck by hayfever this year could occur, `depending on weather conditions'. She said : `if we get prolonged periods of warm, dry weather with intervals of some wet weather between, which helps the grass to keep growing, we will experience a lot of high grass pollen counts. ` grass is the main culprit pollen for hayfever in the uk. ` high and very high pollen counts can trigger hayfever symptoms in people who have not had them before. She added : `in addition, the good weather typically brings increases in air pollution, which can make symptoms worse, and again lead them to occur in people who have been symptom free before.' In addition, she said pollen is becoming more potent, and greater numbers of plants giving off the allergens is also contributing to a rising number of sufferers. Dr emberlin said another contributing factor is that the average hayfever season is becoming longer, typically stretching from april to the end of august\n\nSENTENCE:\nAround 20 million people in the uk are expected to suffer hayfever symptoms this summer, up a third from last year.\n\n",

I think father paul kelly is on the right track, well and truly,' dr aspinall said.' I don't think it's reasonable to murder someone who approaches you sexually. Violence is never a constructive response.' Dr aspinall also appealed to those who resorted to violence at recent anti - islam rallies, as well as a individuals behind an apparent spate of church vandalism in melbourne. ` whenever people feel threatened, there is a natural human tendency to react out of fear,' he said. ` that's exactly what we have to resist.'

Scroll down for video. The pair - - daughters of sir paul's first wife linda, who died of cancer four years previously - - were said to have been less than overjoyed by their father's choice of partner. The remarkable picture is a portent of the bitterness that would follow the wedding in 2002 - - as sir paul and ms mills separated in 2006 and went through a bitter and messy divorce in 2008. Astonishingly, the image is the first to emerge of the former beatle and ms mills from their wedding reception. In another never - before - seen picture, sir paul acts out a mock striptease in front of his delighted bride during the reception, which was attended by 300 guests. Sir paul, then 59, and ms mills had ordered a media blackout of the event in ireland. These pictures belong to the family of sir paul's late housekeeper rose martin, who was among those invited to the event at the 17th century castle leslie in county monaghan. The ceremony was shrouded in such secrecy that on the invitations guests were told only to arrive at a hotel at heathrow airport at an appointed time from where they would be flown to an unnamed destination. Other guests included the only other surviving beatle, ringo starr, the band's legendary producer sir george martin, pretenders singer chrissy hynde, and model twiggy.

Other guests included the only other surviving beatle, ringo starr, the band's legendary producer sir george martin, pretenders singer chrissy hynde, and model twiggy. Sir paul and ms mills are pictured ( left ) in 2003 at a screening for the film `concert for george' and ( right ) in hollywood in 2007.

And now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity, including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings. Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video. These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth. The photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry. The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail. The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ).

The photos were shot by linden gledhill from staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a phd in biochemistry. The 51 - year - old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects' scale - covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their greek order name of lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye - catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail. The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the eastern tiger swallowtail ( stock image ). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north america and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern us, where it is common in many different habitats. Each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring,\n\nSENTENCE:\nIt is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern north america.\n\n",

All three achieved a great deal while playing for england and are well - respected figures within the game. Sportsmail takes a closer look at the trio battling to become the most powerful man in english cricket. Alec stewart ( age 52 ). Current job : director of cricket at surrey. Show us your medals : played 133 tests, more than any england cricketer. Players he likes : has established a rapport at surrey with the out - of - favour kevin pietersen - - says english cricket needs to be bold. Reason it might happen : stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. Reason it might not : he's only interested if there's a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Alec stewart during surrey's media day at the oval ahead of the new county cricket season. Stewart is hoisted into the air on his team - mate's shoulders after beating south africa at the oval in 2003. Andrew strauss ( age 38 ). Current job : sky commentator. Show us your medals : captained england to home - and - away ashes triumphs. Players he likes : a big fan of his former opening partner alastair cook, who he insists will score plenty of test runs this summer. Reason it might happen : widely respected within english cricket for taking the team to the top of the test rankings. Reason it might not : strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator - - and is enjoying it. Andrew strauss captained england to ashes triumphs both home and away and now works for sky sports. Strauss in action for england at the 2011 cricket world cup against india in bangalore.

Brian lutfy, center, his son, jason, left, and stepson sebastien enjoy original kentucky fried chicken at the harland sanders cafe and museum in corbin on saturday. Brian lufty, 52, one of the fathers who packed the four sons into a van, made the 34 - hour round trip mission for his third time to visit the harland sanders cafe and museum in corbin. His tales of earlier visits to the kfc inspired the most recent trip. The group left from montreal on thursday and arrived at the restaurant on saturday afternoon. ` neil and i have been friends for 35 years, and doing ongoing, crazy things have been special for us. But to bring our sons here with us makes it even more fun,' lufty told the times tribune. ` we do practical jokes with our kids. We've done skits that we taped along the way.

The tiny montana outpost was established in the 1860s by miners looking for gold and silver, but it was devastated by fire around 1912 and deserted a few years later. While the town has since been restored, it remains empty, and local folklore says the area is haunted by former residents, with visitors saying they heard music and laughter, even in winter, and the sound of doors slamming in cottages where there aren't any doors. Now the u. S. Bureau of land management is offering free food, housing a job to people willing to live in garnet and work as a tour operator, as the government prepares the village to become a new tourist stop.

Prices have fallen by the largest amount in almost a decade as supermarkets continue to slash the cost of milk, vegetables and meat as they compete with each other and with emerging budget chains for customers. And on the high street clothes and footwear have become even more affordable - with prices dropping by around 7. 8 per cent in the last 12 months - as the low cost of oil makes transporting and selling goods even cheaper. Consumers are taking to the shops as they cash in on the falling prices of supermarket staples and clothes. Milk, bread, eggs, cheese and roasting chickens have seen the biggest fall in price at the supermarket checkout as the large chains have been forced to reduce their prices to compete with the rise of budget stores aldi and lidl. According to the british retail consortium - nielsen price index, goods in shops cost 2. 1 per cent lower this march than the same time last year, the guardian reported. This is the biggest fall in prices in a single year since records began nine years ago, in 2006. It is also a larger drop than the 1. 7 per cent recorded the month before. Fresh food prices have dropped by around 0. 9 per cent in a year, while the figure for electrical items was even greater, falling 5. 7 per cent in the last 12 months. And the falling costs for consumers, which have been taking place for the last 23 months, show no sign of stopping. Mike watkins, head of retailer and business insight at data firm nielsen told the financial times : `prices continue to fall across the retail industry and deflation is likely to be with us for the near future, which means shoppers are going to be able to stretch their budgets further when shopping in store or online.'

Prices have fallen by the largest amount in almost a decade as supermarkets continue to slash the cost of milk, vegetables and meat as they compete with each other and with emerging budget chains for customers. And on the high street clothes and footwear have become even more affordable - with prices dropping by around 7. 8 per cent in the last 12 months - as the low cost of oil makes transporting and selling goods even cheaper. Consumers are taking to the shops as they cash in on the falling prices of supermarket staples and clothes. Milk, bread, eggs, cheese and roasting chickens have seen the biggest fall in price at the supermarket checkout as the large chains have been forced to reduce their prices to compete with the rise of budget stores aldi and lidl. According to the british retail consortium - nielsen price index, goods in shops cost 2. 1 per cent lower this march than the same time last year, the guardian reported. This is the biggest fall in prices in a single year since records began nine years ago, in 2006. It is also a larger drop than the 1. 7 per cent recorded the month before. Fresh food prices have dropped by around 0. 9 per cent in a year, while the figure for electrical items was even greater, falling 5. 7 per cent in the last 12 months. And the falling costs for consumers, which have been taking place for the last 23 months, show no sign of stopping. Mike watkins, head of retailer and business insight at data firm nielsen told the financial times : `prices continue to fall across the retail industry and deflation is likely to be with us for the near future, which means shoppers are going to be able to stretch their budgets further when shopping in store or online.'

A massive rescue operation involving more than 1, 300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the sea of okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the dalny vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the kamchatka peninsula. The russian freezer trawler, called the dalny vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation. Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told russian television on thursday. It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said oleg kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on russian television came after the federal investigative committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit `an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the interfax news agency said. Early reports added that the dalny vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing.

A massive rescue operation involving more than 1, 300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the sea of okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the dalny vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the kamchatka peninsula. The russian freezer trawler, called the dalny vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation. Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told russian television on thursday. It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said oleg kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on russian television came after the federal investigative committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit `an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the interfax news agency said. Early reports added that the dalny vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing.

Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children's motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by goldsmiths university in london and ohio state university. More than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research ( stock image shown ). Psychologists from goldsmiths university of london, and ohio state university in the us studied more than 13, 000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the uk, canada, japan, germany, russia and the us. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins' shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non - shared - environment factors had the largest effect on the children's motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact.

But new research suggests it may actually have been infectious diseases carried by our modern ancestors as they migrated out of africa that finished them off. Scientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim that neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today. Scroll down for video. Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to europe by modern humans as they migrated out of africa. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals. It has been around 30, 000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co - existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthal dna. These `legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our hla system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from neanderthals. Other researchers have suggested that humans outside africa are more vulnerable to type 2 diabetes because they interbred with neanderthals. Researchers from oxford and plymouth universities have also found that\n\nSENTENCE:\nScientists studying the latest genetic, fossil and archaeological evidence claim neanderthals suffered from a wide range of diseases that still plague us today.\n\n",

Neanderthals, like the reconstruction above on display at the natural history museum in london, may have succumbed to infectious diseases carried to europe by modern humans as they migrated out of africa. They have found evidence that suggests our prehistoric cousins would have been infected by diseases such as tuberculosis, typhoid, whooping cough, encephalitis and the common cold. But anthropologists from cambridge university and oxford brookes university say that new diseases carried by modern humans may have led to the downfall of neanderthals. It has been around 30, 000 years since the ancestors of modern - day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient neanderthals. But the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co - existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning europeans now have roughly two per cent neanderthal dna. These `legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, some genes we inherited could have also improved our immunity to other diseases. Scientists have found that part of our hla system, which helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign material in the body, could have come from neanderthals.

One theory is that early modern humans `bullied' their neanderthal cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive. But a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by neanderthals. The researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the early ahmarian culture and the protoaurignacian culture, living in south and west europe and west asia around 40, 000 years ago. They found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than neanderthal - created tools of the same era. Researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived neanderthals - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought. Traditionally, scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of africa to europe. But the new study by nagoya university and the university of tokyo in japan argues neanderthals were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts. ` we're not so special, i don't think we survived neanderthals simply because of technological competence,' said dr seiji kadowaki, first author of the study from nagoya university, japan. On the left is a map of the levant showing the locations of the early ahmarian - related sites analysed in this study.

This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. They brag that their technique has been the result of almost a century of fine - tuning, creating a science that has benefited real - world medical applications. Scroll down for video. Vladmir lenin may have been dead for 90 years, but his corpse looks better than the day he passed. This is the claim made by his embalmers, who have developed experimental techniques to maintain the look and feel of the communist revolutionary's body. Pictured is his body in 1997. The gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the `mausoleum group' which, at its peak, involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader's corpse. According to a detailed report by jeremy hsu in scientific american, the russians prefer to preserve the body's shape, weight, colour and flexibility, rather than biological tissue. ` they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials,' alexei yurchak, professor of social anthropology at the university of california, berkeley told mr hsu. ` that makes it dramatically different from everything in the past, such as mummification.' Yurchak has published a paper on this project in the journal representations, along with a book, `everything was forever, until it was no more : the last soviet generation.' The bolshevik leader's remains were embalmed on stalin's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in moscow apart from a period in the second world war. The revolutionary's body is on public display in a mausoleum on moscow's red square more than two decades after the break - up of the former ussr.

The gruesome job is the responsibility of a team known as the `mausoleum group' which, at its peak, involved 200 scientists working in a lab dedicated to the former leader's corpse. According to a detailed report by jeremy hsu in scientific american, the russians prefer to preserve the body's shape, weight, colour and flexibility, rather than biological tissue. ` they have to substitute occasional parts of skin and flesh with plastics and other materials,' alexei yurchak, professor of social anthropology at the university of california, berkeley told mr hsu. ` that makes it dramatically different from everything in the past, such as mummification.' Yurchak has published a paper on this project in the journal representations, along with a book, `everything was forever, until it was no more : the last soviet generation.' The bolshevik leader's remains were embalmed on stalin's orders when he died aged 53 in 1924 and kept on display in moscow apart from a period in the second world war.

A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the central valley and to millions of residents as far south as san diego.

Officers learned of the alleged relationship after lowrance disclosed details to a coworker who then alerted a dallas isd officer. Mary todd lowrance ( above ), 49, a texas english high school teacher was arrested after being accused of having an improper relationship with a male student over the age of 17, according to authorities. If the student had been a juvenile, the case would have been handled by the dallas police department, miller told the dallas morning news. ` when you get 160, 000 students and 10, 000 teachers, you hear a lot of rumors, and you have to investigate all of them,' said miller. ` and in this case, there was something to it.

Miller said that after lowrance's coworker alerted authorities, it prompted an investigation where interviews were conducted with lowrance, the student and two witnesses. The dallas isd police then got an arrest warrant. Miller said lowrance has been on leave for several weeks while investigators worked on the case, according to nbcdfw.

Beto had looked to have cost his side their progress, with the game heading towards extra time, before substitute gameiro arrived to slot home with five minutes remaining. It had been a risk to start the portuguese keeper, but sevilla boss unai emery decided it one he was prepared to take, despite beto's absence since a game against real madrid in the first week of february. Carlos bacca slams home the early penalty after vitolo had been brought down by neto after five minute. Hulk celebrates his goal with axel witsel but zenit couldn't hold on for extra time in the end. It was a gamble that spectacularly back - fired, with the keeper gifting zenit two of the softest goals imaginable, to see the holders surrender a two - goal lead in the tie. First, just a matter of seconds after the half - time break, with sevilla two goals up on aggregate a cruising, beto dropped the ball, under no pressure, at the feet of salomon rondon, allowing the venezuelan to rekindle the tie from a matter of yards. Then, when brazilian forward hulk hit a speculative, but not overly threatening shot from 40 yards, beto could only flap it over his own line, turning the tie on its head and sending it towards extra time. But as zenit looked to apply the pressure, and beto attempted to atone himself with two stunning saves, one from each of the two goalscorers, the champions struck on the break. Bacca is mobbed by his sevilla team - mates after putting them in complete control of the tie early on. Zenit : lodygin, criscito, neto, lombaerts, smolnikov ; garcia, witsel ; danny, shatov, hulk, rondon - lrb\n\nSENTENCE:\nZenit couldn't score in the end with sevilla two points up.\n\n",

The closed - door contest follows the postponements of monday's and tuesday's games against the white sox until a doubleheader scheduled for may 28 following unrest in baltimore. A source within major league baseball told cnn the league is not aware of any prior closed - door games in major league history. The game at oriole park at camden yards is scheduled to begin at 2 : 05 p. M. Et. The game will be televised on the masn regional cable network. ` `after conferring with local officials, it was determined that wednesday afternoon's game should be played without fan admittance in order to minimize safety concerns,'' major league baseball said. The office of new commissioner rob manfred said the league and orioles will keep an eye on the situation in baltimore. ` `our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by violence in baltimore, and everyone in our game hopes for peace and the safety of a great american city,'' manfred said. Hall of famer frank thomas tweeted that the series should be moved to a later date. The former white sox star said, `` playing in front of a empty house makes no sense! !' ' the game changes come as the situation in the city remains tense following monday's riots, with more protests and arrests tuesday. Mayor stephanie rawlings - blake said the closed game will mean `` another sad day in our city.' ' `` we're a sports town. We love our o's,'' rawlings - blake told cnn's wolf blitzer. The orioles said tickets from monday's postponed game can be used for admittance on may 28. Fans with tickets for tuesday's game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including may 28. The team also\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe game should be played without fan admittance.\n\n",

The six - strong gang dressed in high - vis jackets were captured on cctv working throughout thursday night having successfully broken into the basement of the building in the heart of london's jewellery district.

Images obtained by the daily mirror reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland yard tonight refused to confirm to mailonline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm.

The 28 - year - old runner was so far ahead of the pack it wasn't clear to her which way she was meant to go. Wrong way : heidi bretscher, 28, said she was on pace to beat her personal record when she, and the two cyclists who were accompanying her, missed an unmarked turn. Retracing her steps : at mile 19, bretscher was leading the women's race by about 30 minutes. She found a police officer who gave her a ride back to mile 17. Somehow, she ended up running entirely off the planned route and around a lake that wasn't even on the course. Despite her unscheduled detour, ms. Bretscher's was brought back on track by a couple of helpful cops who drove her in their patrol cars back to the point in the race where things became muddled. After working out her timings and distances she still managed to cross the line well ahead of her closest rival. ` i'm a little frustrated,' she told abc 11 following her victory.' I ran three miles off course because i didn't know which way to run in the race.' ` usually when you cross the finish line, you're really excited. I wasn't excited,' she said.' I was just really nervous that i was going to get in trouble because i didn't stay on course.'

The initial picture released on tuesday shows a couple of orange - tinged blobs : pluto and its largest moon, charon. But the probe will soon be beaming back much sharper images and a wealth of other information about pluto's remote, unexplored corner of the solar system. ` `this is pure exploration ; we're going to turn points of light into a planet and a system of moons before your eyes,'' said alan stern, new horizons' principal investigator. Launched in 2006, new horizons is nearing the crucial point in its epic voyage of more than 3 billion miles. The probe is due to make its closest approach to pluto on july 14. ` `in an unprecedented flyby this july, our knowledge of what the pluto system is really like will expand exponentially, and i have no doubt there will be exciting discoveries,'' said john grunsfeld, an astronaut and associate administrator of the nasa science mission directorate. Discovered in 1930, pluto was once considered to be the smallest planet in the solar system. But scientists have since revised that view because of pluto's size and location, demoting it to the status of `` dwarf planet'' : a planet that's too small to clear other objects out of its way. Pluto is 1, 400 miles wide, roughly half the width of the continental united states. At 3. 6 billion miles out in the solar system, it's about 40 times as far from the sun as earth is. By discovering more about pluto and its moons, new horizons will shed light on a little - known third zone of the solar system, beyond the rocky planets and the gas giants. The area, known as the kuiper belt, contains `` mysterious small planets and planetary building blocks,'' according\n\nSENTENCE:\nPluto and its largest moon, charon.\n\n",

Durst entered his plea during an arraignment in a new orleans court on weapons charges that accused him of possessing a firearm after a felony conviction and possessing both a firearm and an illegal drug, marijuana. Durst's hands were shackled to his sides, and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium. Unlikely to face charges in california anytime soon : robert durst, 71, pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges. Durst is pictured here last month in new orleans. Attorney dick deguerin whispered into durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before durst said,' i am not guilty, your honor.' Judge franz zibilich asked if durst was making that plea to both charges against him. Deguerin whispered again, and durst said, `yes, your honor.' The weapons arrest has kept durst in new orleans even though he waived extradition to california, where he's charged in the december 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison. Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in new orleans. An affidavit filed there accuses durst of breaking a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms. Prosecutors have asked a u. S. Magistrate judge to order durst to be brought to federal court for a hearing next thursday - - and that he remain in u. S. Custody until the federal matter is resolved. Durst, an estranged member of the family that runs 1 world trade center in new york, has had multiple run - ins with the law\n\nSENTENCE:\nRobert durst, 71, pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges.\n\n",

Durst's hands were shackled to his sides, and two defense attorneys lifted him from an armchair to his feet to walk to the podium. Unlikely to face charges in california anytime soon : robert durst, 71, pleaded not guilty thursday to two state gun charges in louisiana in a case that would delay his extradition to la to face murder charges. Durst is pictured here last month in new orleans. Attorney dick deguerin whispered into durst's ear as he entered the plea. He had to whisper twice before durst said,' i am not guilty, your honor.' Judge franz zibilich asked if durst was making that plea to both charges against him. Deguerin whispered again, and durst said, `yes, your honor.' The weapons arrest has kept durst in new orleans even though he waived extradition to california, where he's charged in the december 2000 death of a longtime friend. Durst is being held without bail in the mental ward of a state prison. Durst's story also is playing out two miles away in federal court in new orleans.

Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1, 000 - foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. ` `he was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition,'' capt. Thomas grenz told cnn by phone friday. That man, louis jordan, 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35 - foot pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving conway, south carolina, to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. ` `it took so long,'' jordan said. ` `it moved so slowly.' ' the boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to jordan. His father, frank jordan, told cnn's jim sciutto that he was expecting his son to look different. ` `he looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like i thought he probably would be,'' he said. Lost at sea for 66 days. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for jordan. The weather wouldn't cooperate. Records show there were more than a dozen storms off the coast of the carolinas during the time he was missing.

Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. ` `it took so long,'' jordan said. ` `it moved so slowly.'

Instead, the night turned to tragedy when the little girl rana died either during birth or within minutes afterwards. A coroner found that the care given by the midwife who assisted at the birth in 2012 was `grossly inadequate' and may have contributed to the death of the baby. But in a move many people would find extraordinary, the couple refuses to blame the midwife, and are in fact is defending her actions. Alanna and stephen goetzinger ( pictured with their daughters kayla, right, and alice, left ) lost their daughter during a stillbirth in 2012 and have spoken out against the coroner's report which blames their midwife. Coroner james mcdougall said that the midwife failed to adequately prepare for the rana's birth, allowed the delivery to take place in `unsafe conditions', and that her failure to provide proper medical assistance may have caused the death of the goeztinger's baby.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and two weapons charges, setting the stage for his trial in fall river, massachusetts, that began in january. He's accused of orchestrating the shooting death of lloyd. During closing arguments, prosecutor william mccauley called the football player the trigger man. Jury deliberations began tuesday. Even after closing arguments, the motive is still unclear but not legally required to get a conviction. Still, jurors like to know a motive. Evidence collected in lloyd's death led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston. It's scheduled to begin in may, but officials say it will be pushed back.

Police said three armed men took a five-figure sum from the vehicle in the city's sauchiehall street on monday at about 21:45. A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken. The area around the bank, which is near the buchanan galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police. Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of â£50,000. Following the robbery, the three men got into a white seat leon car, which sped off along west nile street towards the cowcaddens area. The car has since been found in scott street, near stow college. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination. Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on west nile street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery. Officers are appealing for the cyclist to contact them. The suspects are described as wearing dark-coloured clothing and balaclavas to conceal their identities. Det insp alasdair barlow said: \"we are reviewing cctv images in and around the city centre. \"we would like to hear from anyone who may have witnessed the incident or noticed the car, in particular the cyclist. \"as the car left the scene, it was being driven at speed so people may have noticed its excessive speed.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nTwo security guards have been threatened during a robbery at a bank in edinburgh.\n\n",

Neither side had amassed more than 215 in an innings in the previous three tests and india, who lead 2-0, were struggling on 66-3 and 139-6 in delhi. But ajinkya rahane hit 89 not out in half-century partnerships with virat kohli (44) and ravindra jadeja (24). Recalled fast bowler kyle abbott (3-23) and spinner dane piedt (4-101) were the only south african wicket takers. Piedt, 25, playing just his second test, took four of the first five wickets to fall, including that of kohli whose fluent 70-run stand with rahane was ended in bizarre fashion. The india captain, who won the toss for a fourth time, smashed a full-blooded sweep into temba bavuma at short-leg and after the ball ballooned into the air, wicketkeeper dane vilas dived forward to take the catch. That sparked a mini collapse with three wickets falling for three runs before rahane, who hit two sixes and nine boundaries in his first half century at home, steadied the innings and took india beyond 200. Rahane was helped by jadeja, whose 59-ball innings was ended by a smart dean elgar catch at midwicket off the bowling of abbott. South african abbott, who had earlier bowled cheteshwar pujara and wriddhiman saha, conceded just 23 runs in 17 overs to continue his push to start the four-test series against england, which begins on 26 december in durban.\n\nSENTENCE:\nIndia's batsmen dominated the first day of the third and final test against south africa with an innings-and-96-run win.\n\n",

I'm not able to do my job.\" The former brighton man continued: \"i am going to have to sit it out again for four months before i can kick a ball in the league again. \"i'll try to make the best of it. It is hard to train on your own and keep yourself motivated but it is something which has got to be done.\" Cox left orient on 1 september after turning down a move to league one northampton town. Having spent six years with the o's, scoring 59 times in 275 appearances, cox said he was \"an emotional wreck\" on his departure from brisbane road. \"i didn't really want to leave but, circumstances being what they were, i felt like i had no choice,\" he said. \"we had come to our conclusion that we were going to go our separate ways. I can't really elaborate on it for legal reasons. \"it is a club i will always love. When i finish playing i want to be a manager and if i can go back there and manage one day that would be great.\" Cox, who has only just recovered from a long-term knee injury, is aiming to agree a contract with an efl club which will commence in january before seeking a short-term deal with a non-league side to keep up his match fitness. \"i was just getting back in the groove,\" he said. \"if i can get something sorted sooner rather than later league-wise, then great. \"hopefully the clubs i speak to will understand my situation. I'm not too proud to play in lower divisions as i need to play. \"come january, i need to be ready to kick on.\" Cox has already held initial negotiations with league two side crawley town. \"it interests me because they are local to where i am,\" he said. \"it ticks the boxes and i used to play with the captain jimmy smith at orient. The manager [dermot drummy] wants attractive attacking football, which is great for me because that is the way i like to play. \"by no means is it a done deal.

The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories. Lee was described by his wife as a being \"loving and normal young man\". Judge kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his \"own strange pleasure\", they were serious matters as \"children were abused for these images to be made\". He added that children would continue to be abused while people like lee continued to view such material, and that \"society would not tolerate such behaviour\". Judge kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist lee or the community. Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images. Earlier, prosecutor simon jenkins said that when police went to lee's then belfast home on 5 june, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for. On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which lee admitted creating. During interview, lee said that he had been downloading images \"for perhaps the last nine years\". Defence lawyer taylor campbell said that lee had admitted his guilt from the outset, pleading guilty at arraignment, and was entirely frank and co-operative with police.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA man who admitted downloading and viewing child pornography has been spared jail.\n\n",

The plans resolve a concussion lawsuit filed against the federation by parents but us soccer said it had planned to introduce a new safety campaign. They also intend to limit the amount of heading in practice for children between the ages of 11 and 13. \"although these are recommendations, they are based on the advice of the us soccer medical committee,\" it said. \"therefore us soccer strongly urges that they be followed.\" The lawsuit filed by young players and their parents in august 2014 accused governing bodies, including fifa and the california youth soccer association, of acting \"carelessly and negligently\" and failing to protect young players. Us soccer said the reforms would also include \"modifications to substitution rules in relation to concussions\" and would be \"requirements for players that are part of us soccer's youth national teams and the development academy.\" It added: \"protecting the health and safety of athletes and preventing injuries is critically important to us soccer.\" There has been previous criticism of football's attitude towards concussions but new rules have been brought in for premier league matches after tottenham goalkeeper hugo lloris continued playing after he lost consciousness. Following those measures dr michael grey, a leading neuroscientist from the university of birmingham, said it was dangerous for children to head a football. The football association offer no specific guidance for children heading footballs in england but said it had \"noted the new rule changes outlined by us soccer and will closely monitor any available new research in this area\". The fa also said it would shortly announce new guidelines formed by an independent expert panel \"which look at how to identify, manage and treat suspected head injuries and to manage a player's safe return to play at all levels of football\". It added: \"however, they do not relate to how football should be played - something which is governed by the laws of the game set out by fifa as the world's governing body. \"in addition to this new guidance, the panel has been tasked to identify key research questions into the long-term effects of head injury or repeated concussion episodes on the brain. The fa will take these research questions to fifa in due course.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe united states soccer federation has announced reforms aimed at protecting young players from concussion.\n\n",

The very large array (vla) traced the presence of ammonia in the gas giant to study the circulation systems below the visible cloud tops. For features such as the planet's great red spot - a huge storm that has raged for at least 400 years - the scientists can see something of its roots. The observations go many tens of kilometres into the atmosphere. \"what really excites me is just the level of detail we see,\" said team-member michael wong from the university of california, berkeley. \"in our maps you can see different zones, turbulent features, vortices - even the great red spot. \"this has all been made possible by an upgrade to the vla and a new technique developed by one of our co-workers,\" he told bbc news. The karl g jansky very large array is based in the desert of new mexico, close to the town of socorro. As its name suggests, it is multi-antenna telescope. The upgrade dr wong is referring to has made the facility a far more sensitive tool for studying the radio emissions coming from objects in space. And the new technique he mentions counters the smearing effect you would ordinarily expect to get if you took a long exposure of a rapidly rotating body (jupiter's \"day\" lasts just 10 hours). The result is a wonderfully detailed impression of what is happening under the immediate surface of the many-banded weather systems that race across the top of planet's atmosphere. The team looks at the glow of ammonia because it is a tracer for the dynamical flow in the planet's gases, which are dominated by hydrogen and helium. At earth, you might do something similar by using water as the tracer. \"we see the actual glow of the ammonia itself, and the variation in depth is correlated with brightness,\" explained dr wong. \"the deepest we can see in this dataset is about 12 bar - 12 times the earth's atmospheric pressure.\" Plumes of ammonia are observed to rise up in waves. The team writes in the journal science that the ammonia in these plumes will eventually condense out at higher altitudes, and could explain the ammonia ice clouds detected by the galileo spacecraft in the 1990s. \"all told, there is a wealth of information about the structure of jupiter's atmosphere in these new vla images,\" said imke de pater, the lead author on the science paper. \"we hope to resolve a number of outstanding questions with these and future studies using similar techniques.\" Prof de pater wants to try similar observations at the gas giants saturn and uranus. The research is a nice prelude to the next probe set to visit jupiter: the us space agency satellite juno arrives at the enormous planet on 4 july. Its remote sensing instruments aim to characterise the full internal structure of the planet, right down to its rocky core - if indeed it has one.

Nhs tayside had the highest number followed by nhs lanarkshire  and nhs greater glasgow and clyde. The figures also revealed that more than 560,000 people missed at least one nhs outpatient appointment in 2014/15. Each missed appointment is thought to cost the nhs â£120, putting the total cost to the health service at â£100m. The figures were obtained by the scottish conservatives through a freedom of information request. The statistics revealed:. The scottish tories have previously suggested those who fail to show for appointments on a certain number of occasions could face some sanction from the health board. The party has also urged the scottish government look at more innovative ways of reminding patients to turn up at appointments. Scottish conservative leader ruth davidson said: \"missing a hospital appointment can happen to anyone, and for a range of reasons. \"but when you're getting to the point where you are missing five or more in the space of just a year, something really has to be done. \"that is costing the nhs thousands of pounds, wreaking havoc with hospital planning, and of course potentially harming the health of the patient involved. \"we've been critical of the nhs in the past for cancelling appointments and procedures, so it's only fair we do everything we can to make sure patient no-shows are limited too. \"we need to find ways to ensure people turn up at the appointments that are made and stop showing contempt for our nhs, doctors and nursing staff.\" Health secretary shona robison said the percentage of patients missing appointments has decreased slightly over the last five years. She added: \"however, it is important that all health boards understand why patients are not attending appointments and look at ways to reduce this. \"the scottish government is committed to supporting health boards to deliver secure messaging services, including reminders. \"health scotland also recently published a report looking at those who did not attend appointments over a 10 year period from 2002/03 to 2011/12. \"we welcome this report which will provide boards with further learning on the issue of non-attendance.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe number of patients who failed to turn up for hospital appointments in scotland last year was at its highest since records began, according to new figures.\n\n",

The firm, which controls two-fifths of the scotch whisky industry, reported scotch sales down 5% by volume. However, single malts from scotland continued their rise, led by the singleton in the us and taiwan. American whiskey sales were also strengthened by apple-flavoured bottlings. The london-based company has lost momentum due to slowing growth in key markets, including south america and china. It has had lower shipments, as wholesalers have pulled back on stock-holding. Despite flat comparable sales, diageo posted a rise in pre-tax profits - from £2.7bn to £2.9bn. A big increase in volume of sales was driven by the acquisition of united spirits in india, which boosted reported net sales by 5%. Currency movements had an impact on its results, most significantly the venezuelan bolivar and the russian ruble. That cut £370m from sales and £100m from operating profit, once translated into sterling. Some markets saw diageo facing tough price competition, including smirnoff vodka in the us and johnnie walker whisky in brazil. Notable improvements in sales were reported for johnnie walker in mexico, while guinness returned to growth in its uk and irish home market. American blonde lager drove guinness sales up in the us. Net sales were up 6% in africa. Other developments during the financial year included a buyout of the remaining half of the don julio tequila brand, the sale of gleneagles hotel and resort in perthshire, and a shifting of strategy in south africa to focus on spirits. Diageo chief executive ivan menezes said the performance reflected the company's sales challenges, and that further changes were under way to sharpen the business. He added: \"we have consistently applied a long-term perspective in making changes, despite the short-term challenges we have faced from an external environment where currency volatility continues to impact the emerging market consumer.\" He claimed the current financial year would see volume of sales improve, rising to about 5% organic sales growth from 2017, with improved margins.\n\nSENTENCE:\nDiageo, the world's biggest distiller of spirits, has reported a drop in sales in the last financial year.\n\n",

Mara salvatrucha and mara 18 street said they would commit to zero crime and zero violence on the streets. Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Although no formal peace deal has been signed, the apparent ceasefire is thought to be the first step towards a more lasting agreement. \"our truce is with god, with society and with the authorities,\" announced a spokesman for mara salvatrucha, identified only as marco. \"we ask society and the authorities to forgive us for the damage we have done,\" he said at a news conference inside a prison in the honduran city of san pedro sula. A leader of the rival 18 street gang - who did not want to be identified - offered the same promises, but only \"if the government will listen,\" he added. On monday, the honduran president porfirio lobo personally offered his support for the truce. \"we have to look for anything that's an alternative to violence,\" he told the associated press news agency. \"on the part of the government, we are open to any process that can lower violence.\" The roman catholic bishop romulo emiliani, who helped to broker the deal, said last week that the gangs needed government help to break away from their criminal activities, which included extorting money from businesses to finance their war. He said the authorities should try to turn honduras' prisons into rehabilitation centres. His comments were echoed by gang leader marco, who called on the government to support craft workshops so that they could work, earn a living and be reintegrated into society. \"i want my son to be a doctor or a cameraman, not a gangster,\" he said. The bbc central america correspondent will grant says this is a significant step towards a full peace accord. He adds that, in honduras, hopes remain high that this latest plan could help tackle gang crime in the country. The deal follows a similar pact reached more than a year ago in neighbouring el salvador. The peace agreement there has roughly held together and, the authorities say, has contributed to a significant reduction in the murder rate and incidences of other violent crimes. The salvadorian government says homicides have dropped about 52%. Mara salvatrucha and mara 18 street have their roots in the 1980s in southern california. They were created in los angeles and its suburbs by poor, mostly illegal, immigrants who had escaped civil wars in central america. When the conflicts ended there, many gang members were deported from the us, exporting la's gang culture with them.\n\nSENTENCE:\nTwo rival street gangs in honduras have agreed to end their long-running war.\n\n",

The price of brent crude oil fell below $39 a barrel at one point, its lowest since december 2008. The iea said demand in the current quarter was growing by 1.3 million barrels a day, down from 2.2 million barrels in the previous quarter. The iea predicts that will slip back to 1.2 million barrels a day next year. The price of brent crude fell to $38.90 a barrel at one point, before recovering slightly to $39.13 - still down 60 cents in the trading session. Us crude oil also fell, down 50 cents to $36.12 a barrel. Oil prices are down more than 10% over the week. The trigger was a meeting of oil producers' cartel opec late last week, which broke up in disarray as the member countries failed to agree to put a lid on production. Opec producers pumped more oil in november than in any month since late 2008, almost 32 million barrels per day. That comes at a time when the world's economic growth is slowing, blunting demand for raw materials. The iea said that although consumption was likely to have peaked in the third quarter, demand growth of 1.2 million barrels a day was still healthy. Earlier this week, the us energy information administration forecast that us shale oil production, now a major source of oil supply, would fall in january for the ninth month in a row. Sustained falls in output could help to stabilise the price of oil, although some market forecasters suggest the price could continue to fall to as low as $20 a barrel.\n\nSENTENCE:\nOil prices have fallen sharply after the international energy agency ( iea ) said demand for the fuel is likely to have peaked.\n\n",

The rural grave, discovered last november in the town of tetelcingo, consists of two 10m (33ft) deep pits. Prosecutors say that the bodies may have been dumped illegally by morgue officials, but the investigation into who is responsible is ongoing. Morelos is among the worst-affected states in mexico's epidemic of drug-related violence. At least 20,000 people have disappeared across mexico, the un estimates - other organisation put the number far higher. Investigators at tetelcingo worked under a yellow tent as families of missing persons and national human rights commission representatives looked on. Genetic samples will be taken from each set of remains to attempt identification before they are reburied in marked graves. The exhumation is expected to take about five days. State prosecutor javier perez duron said an investigation was under way into who was responsible for the illegal mass burial. \"it is extremely important and the highest responsibility to count the bodies and give them a dignified burial,\" mr duron said. Experts from the autonomous university of the state of morelos (uaem) have been called in to help with dna testing. Alejandro vera, rector of uaem, said: \"we recognize the tireless struggle of the relatives and victims' organisations of the more than 30,000 missing in this country that's sinking into barbarism.\" Mr vera founded a program to help those whose loved ones have disappeared in mexico's drug war. At least 20,000 people are thought to have disappeared.\n\nSENTENCE:\nProsecutors in the mexican state of morelos have begun exhuming more than 100 bodies from a mass grave.\n\n",

Speaking after briefing the security council on the peace process, staffan de mistura said a partial truce agreed in february was \"barely alive\". Violence in syria has intensified in recent days, despite the ceasefire. At least 20 civilians were reportedly killed on wednesday in government strikes on a hospital and nearby residential building in eastern aleppo. The dead included children, a dentist and the only paediatrician left in rebel-held areas of the city, civil defence volunteers told afp news agency. The upsurge in fighting in syria's largest city comes amid reports that government forces, backed by russian air power, are gearing up for a major offensive there. Russia's continuing war. Has opportunity for peace been lost? What is left of syria? Assad's growing confidence. The escalation has threatened to derail the un-brokered peace talks, which resumed last month. The western-backed opposition delegation, the high negotiations committee (hnc), last week suspended its role to protest against alleged ceasefire violations by the government and a fall in humanitarian aid deliveries to besieged areas. Speaking on wednesday after a third round of talks in geneva, mr de mistura said the fragile \"cessation of hostilities\" \"could collapse any time\". He said that over the past 48 hours an average of one syrian had been killed every 25 minutes and one wounded every 13 minutes. For the peace talks to succeed, mr de mistura said, hostilities would need to be reduced to the levels seen immediately following the february agreement. Calling on the us and russia to co-operate, mr de mistura said that the legacies of both president barack obama and president vladimir putin were linked to the success of the peace process in syria. There will be one or two more rounds of talks before july, mr de mistura said. He added: \"there are still major differences on the major issues, but there is movement on certain areas where there was not before.\" Mr de mistura also said that equal rights and equal representation in major institutions for women was essential to the transition to a new syria. The peace talks do not involve the al-qaeda-linked al-nusra front and the so-called islamic state, which have been fighting government forces and other rebels across syria. The uk-based syrian observatory for human rights monitoring group confirmed on wednesday that the air strikes on a hospital and nearby buildings in aleppo were carried out by \"regime airplanes\". Separately, 11 people were killed in western aleppo earlier on wednesday, the syrian observatory said. More than 270,000 people have been killed since syria's bitter civil war conflict erupted in 2011 and millions have been forced to flee.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe peace process in syria could collapse `` any time'', the un special envoy has warned.\n\n",

James purnell said it would increase non-payment and cost the bbc £200m. The sum is the equivalent of bbc four, cbbc and cbeebies, which would have to be taken off air, mr purnell said at an event to  relaunch the iplayer service. Culture secretary maria miller said the move should be discussed during talks to renew the bbc's charter before 2017. Mr purnell, who previously held the post in the labour government, said \"it would be a huge risk to do it now\". \"the choice would be: either we take those services off or the government would have to have a higher licence fee,\" he said in reference to bbc four - the arts and culture channel - and the bbc's children's stations. He argued decriminalisation would inevitably lead to greater non-payment of the tv licence, which would force an increase in the fee. It is currently £145.50 and has been frozen at that annual amount since 2010. It is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device. In 2012 about 155,000 people were convicted and fined for not paying the licence fee, while there were some 180,000 prosecutions. Mr purnell added downgrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would penalise the poor. \"either you have a low penalty - in which case the evasion rates would go up and everyone would have to pay a higher licence fee - or a penalty which is higher and more difficult to pay,\" he said. The bbc has previously said \"legislation is a matter for the government\". \"just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 bbc local radio stations,\" it added. The government has floated the idea to ease pressure on the courts system. But it will not be discussed before charter renewal talks - which determine how the bbc is funded what it does and how it is managed. The current bbc charter runs out in 2016. Meanwhile, labour mp john mcdonnell has tabled an early day motion in parliament calling on the bbc to reverse its decision to close bbc three as a television channel. The motion stated bbc three has been the home of programmes including gavin and stacey, and raised fears changes could lead to compulsory redundancies. It added the bbc should receive a licence fee increase that tracks inflation when the corporation's charter is renewed next year.\n\nSENTENCE:\nDowngrading licence fee evasion to a civil offence would be a `` huge risk'' to the bbc, its director general has said.\n\n",

The adapted artwork for the sgt pepper's lonely hearts club band album is worth about??70,000. It was created to celebrate the success of the record - released in june 1967 - for christmas of that year. The artwork is one of five beatles album sleeves to feature in the top 10, compiled by record collector magazine. Sir peter blake's original sgt pepper collage was doctored to replace the faces of the beatles and other notable figures with those of executives from the band's us label capitol. Only about 100 are thought to have been made. 'main attraction' in second place, valued at? ?7,000, are the first 10 numbered copies of the beatles' self-titled 1968 record, which became known as the white album because of its plain white cover. The band's name was embossed on the front of the sleeve, which was designed by pop artist richard hamilton, along with a unique stamped serial number. In third position was a pair of sleeves designed by andy warhol. Madrigals' 1953 work magic key to spanish volumes 1 and 2, and spoken word anti-crime lecture the nation's nightmare, from 1951, have been valued at? ?3,500 and? ?3,000 respectively. At number four was the bizarre us-released compilation album jolly what! England's greatest recording stars: the beatles and frank ifield on stage. The 1964 album, featuring the songs of both the fab four and crooner ifield, is valued at??3,000. The beatles  were also in eighth place for the original album sleeve created for the us release of their yesterday and today record in 1966, which is valued at??2,000. Known as \"the butcher sleeve\" because it featured the musicians posing with dismembered doll parts and slabs of meat, it was quickly withdrawn from the us market. List compiler ian shirley, editor of the rare record price guide 2012, said: \"while pristine records and inserts are vital to securing a top price, the numbered sleeve is the main attraction. \"the hunger to collect low numbers remains undiminished amongst beatles fans.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA beatles album sleeve designed by sir peter blake has topped a list of the most valuable rare records.\n\n",

The company behind the development, tekever, said the technology could in the short term be used to enable people with restricted movement to control aircraft. Longer term the firm said piloting of larger jets, such as cargo planes, could be controlled in this way without the need for a crew on board. However, one aviation expert told the bbc he thought the industry would be unlikely to adopt such technology due to a perception of being potentially unsafe. Drone specialist tekever, which works with security firms, police forces and the military, adapted existing electroencephalography (eeg) technology so it could issue instructions to the software used to give the unmanned drone instructions. Eeg works by detecting activity in specific parts of the brain. After several months of training, \"pilots\" are said to be able to teach their brain how to think about moving a small circle on a computer screen either up or down, which in turn steers the drone left or right. \"we believe people will be able to pilot aircraft just like they perform everyday activities like walking or running,\" said ricardo mendes, tekever's chief operating officer. \"we truly believe that brainflight represents the beginning of a tremendous step change in the aviation field, empowering pilots and de-risking missions, and we're looking forward to deliver these benefits to the market with highly innovative products.\" In the future, some of this technology may be put to use to control much larger aircraft, although mr mendes acknowledged considerable challenges with both regulatory hurdles and public confidence. Those concerns were echoed by john strickland, an independent aviation consultant based in london. \"this to me is certainly at the moment a bridge too far,\" he told the bbc. \"you could get someone radically-minded who might say it, but i'd be surprised if anyone would do it.\" Mr strickland said the airline industry was instead focusing its innovation efforts towards things like better materials and more economical engines. Mr mendes said the technology would incorporate safety measures to counteract the effects of someone having, for example, a seizure while piloting. \"there are algorithms on board that prevent bad things from happening,\" he told the bbc. He added: \"technology is evolving, regulations are evolving. [unmanned jets are] obviously going to happen. The question is not if, it's when.\" Follow dave lee on twitter @daveleebbc.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA drone that can be controlled using the brain has been developed.\n\n",

However, smyth exited from the men's 100m as he finished fifth in his heat in 10.66 -.44 secs outside his best. Reid, meanwhile, false started in his heat and was disqualified. Paralympic star smyth, 27, appeared to start well in heat four but faded after 50m as he finished fifth in 10.66 seconds. \"i got out of the blocks really well and was in a good position in the early stages, however, i then tightened up and people started to pass me,\" explained smyth. \"i was hoping to do better but i still haven't fully recovered from my hamstring injury. \"[but] it has been an incredible experience for me to represent northern ireland at the commonwealth games as i missed out on delhi because of injury.\" London-born reid's first northern ireland outing proved a brief affair as he false started in heat three. Reid, 20, switched allegiance to northern ireland in february as his mother hails from the province.

The apcc said: \"nazir told the board that he intended to go on question time to discuss the recent events in manchester. \"the board, made up of all parties, advised that it would be inappropriate for him to do so, given the number of contentious issues relating to policing which could be raised especially in discussion with politicians who were appearing and during purdah. \"he resigned from his post in order to make this appearance.

Thai officials said the event, which was halted minutes before it was due to start, could have affected relations between the two countries. The hrw report focuses on the treatment of a christian group in vietnam. The group said the thai response showed how freedom of speech had been eroded since the army seized power last year. Thai police said the event at the foreign correspondents club of thailand could \"have an impact on the country's security or could affect the friendship and cooperation between thailand and vietnam\". It is the third human rights event at the venue that has been halted by authorities in the past month. The hrw report describes what it says is the persecution of montagnard christians in vietnam's central highlands. Their religious practices have been described by the vietnamese government as \"evil\". Sunai phasuk, human rights watch's senior researcher in asia, said the decision to cancel the report's launch was \"very disappointing\". \"thailand is now going to be known as the defender of human rights violators in [southeast asia], which adds more damage to thailand's already tarnished international reputation under the military rule,\" he added. Thai authorities have launched a crackdown on critics since the military seized power from a civilian government in may 2014.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThai police have cancelled the launch of a human rights watch ( hrw ) report at a foreign journalists' club in bangkok.\n\n",

This is despite the company reporting a pre-tax profit of â£36m in the first half of 2015, compared with a loss of â£9m a year earlier. The group said the turnaround was due to \"robust trading\" in its food and funeral businesses. These are the first results since radical changes to the business were brought in at the end of last year. Following a review of the business by lord myners, the number of board members was cut drastically, while directors had to have qualifications suited to running the business. Members were also given one vote each. The business recorded a deficit of â£2.5bn in 2013 following massive losses at the co-operative bank. Following changes in the ownership structure of the bank, the co-op group now holds just a 20% stake in the bank. \"we've made a good start on the three year journey to rebuild the co-operative group,\" said chief executive richard pennycook of the half-year results. \"these early days are about fixing the basics - putting in place new leadership teams and providing the investment to deliver the strategies for our businesses. Our customers and members are beginning to see the difference. The food business saw like-for-like sales at its main convenience stores increase by 3.3%, as well as 35 new store openings. The funeral business saw volumes rise by almost 12%, \"principally due to a high death rate\". Despite the improvement in the business seen in the first half of the year, the company warned that \"we expect full-year profitability to reduce year on year, given the planned and increased levels of investment we are making in the second half of the year\". It also said that, again due to greater investment, it was unlikely to declare any dividends before 2018.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe co-operative group has said it is unlikely to declare any dividends before 2018.\n\n",

The ex-pupils were caught up in a violent dispute outside holy cross primary school in 2001, which made headlines around the world at the time. The department of justice confirmed the payments after a freedom of information request from the belfast telegraph. The doj has received eight claims so far, three of which have been settled. The payments were made under the terms of the northern ireland criminal injuries compensation scheme 2002. However, the department would not disclose how much money has been paid out to the former holy cross pupils, in order to protect their identities. It told the newspaper this level of detail was \"exempt from disclosure\" under the freedom of information act and would \"contravene the first principle of the data protection act\". The school was thrust into the international spotlight at the start of term in september 2001, when hundreds of loyalist protesters tried to block the main route taken by the children and their parents on their walk to class. The three-month protest was sparked by a local dispute between catholic and protestant residents in ardoyne, north belfast. The protestants claimed that catholics were attacking their homes and said the school protest was their way of highlighting their concerns. However, stones, bottles, fireworks and even a blast bomb were used during weeks of unrest. Following the initial violence, the police and army put up crash barriers to keep a corridor route open for the holy cross pupils. Armed police officers escorted the children to class until the dispute was resolved. Ardoyne's parish priest at the time, fr aidan troy, told the belfast telegraph he could \"fully understand why people who have been through trauma would want to apply for compensation\". \"these were girls aged between four and 11, they were very young and very impressionable and were deeply affected by it. Every one of us were,\" he said. The priest added that while he would not \"go down the route of compensation myself\" he could \"well imagine the impact would be very great on children at such a formative age\". \"you could see their trauma,\" said fr troy. About 100 pupils needed counselling due to their daily ordeal, according to principal at the time, anne tanney. Speaking to the bbc in 2004, she said that even as an adult, she was traumatised by the protests. \"there were times when i couldn't eat, couldn't sleep,\" she said. \"i used to bite my lip, trying not to cry in front of the children.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nFormer pupils who were injured during a loyalist protest in north belfast have been paid compensation.\n\n",

He was responding to reports beijing has deployed surface-to-air missiles on a disputed island in the region. China dismissed the reports as \"hype\", but said it had the right under international law to defend itself. Several nations claim territory in the resource-rich south china sea, which is also an important shipping route. A spokesman for mr kerry said satellite images appeared to confirm china had deployed anti-aircraft missiles on woody or yongxing island in the paracels. The island is claimed by china, taiwan and vietnam and the presence of missiles would significantly increase tensions. Mr kerry said the us expected to have a \"very serious conversation\" with china over its presence. \"there is every evidence, every day, that there has been an increase of militarisation from one kind or another. It's a serious concern,\" he said. The latest images of woody island were captured by imagesat international. A picture dated 3 february shows a beach on the island empty. By 14 february it contains several missile launchers and support vehicles. But the chinese foreign minister, wang yi, said reports were a western media invention. He defended \"the limited and necessary self-defence facilities\" on islands inhabited by chinese personnel as \"consistent with the right for self-preservation and self-protection.... under the international law\". China has been carrying out extensive land reclamation work in the region, which it says is legal and for civilian purposes. But the work has angered other countries which also claim the territory, and there is growing concern about the implications of the area becoming militarised. The south china sea dispute has been a topic of debate at a meeting of south east asian regional leaders in california. Us president barack obama said the members had discussed the need for \"tangible steps\" to reduce tensions. Rival countries have wrangled over territory in the south china sea for centuries, but tension has steadily increased in recent years. Its islets and waters are claimed in part or in whole by taiwan, china, vietnam, the philippines, malaysia and brunei. China has backed its expansive claims with island-building and naval patrols, while the us says it opposes restrictions on freedom of navigation and unlawful sovereignty claims - by all sides, but seen by many as aimed at china. The frictions have sparked concern that the area is becoming a flashpoint with global consequences.\n\nSENTENCE:\nUs secretary of state john kerry has expressed `` serious concern'' over the militarisation of the south china sea.\n\n",

Benchmark brent crude hit $50.22 per barrel at one stage on thursday, its highest level since early november. The rise followed us data showing that oil inventories had fallen after supply disruptions due to fires in canada. Brent crude has now risen 80% since it hit 13-year lows of below $28 a barrel at the start of the year. Us crude oil inventories fell by 4.2 million barrels to 537.1 million barrels in the week to may 20, according to us department of energy data. Canada is the biggest supplier to the us and wildfires in the western provinces have reduced supplies by about a million barrels per day. Talks in recent months between opec and russia about freezing oil production had already encouraged a price rise. Short-term disruptions to oil supplies have also lifted the price, offsetting higher production from iran and saudi arabia. As well as the disruption to key oil production facilities in canada, attacks by militant groups continue to restrict oil pipelines in nigeria. Demand has also been better than expected from major economies such as china, india and russia. Michael hewson, chief market analyst at cmc markets, said: \"we do now appear to be seeing the effects that the decline in us output is having, and while supplies remain elevated, the glut does now appear to be diminishing.\" Against this backdrop, analysts are starting to raise their forecasts. Goldman sachs said earlier this month that it now expected oil prices to consistently hit $50 a barrel in the second half of 2016 and $60 by the end of 2017. The us bank said: \"the oil market continues to deliver its share of surprises, with low prices driving disruptions in nigeria, higher output in iran and better demand. \"with each of these shifts significant in magnitude, the oil market has gone from nearing storage saturation to being in deficit much earlier than we expected.\" In a sign of growing confidence, oil companies have started preparing for higher prices. Bp said last month it had budgeted for prices of at least between $50 and $55 a barrel in 2017. And last month us oil producer pioneer natural resources announced plans to add up to 10 new rigs when the oil price gets back up to $50. Adam laird, an investment manager at hargreaves lansdown, told the bbc: \"this is an area that's been starved of resources and investment and that psychological barrier [of $50] could be enough to make some executives reassess.\" However, mr laird cautioned that price volatility was likely to continue. \"it's too early to say this is the beginning of the big rebound,\" he said. Abhishek deshpande, an oil markets analyst at natixis, agreed and said: \"we believe that the market is going up, but if it goes too quickly there will be auto-corrections.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nOil prices have risen above $ 50 a barrel for the first time this year.\n\n",

The sum, covering january 2013 to october 2014, included money spent on in-house staff, third party companies and advertising agencies. Some residents said this was a \"waste of money\" and the states would need to \"measure its effectiveness\". Deputy heidi soulsby said when it comes to advertising \"we've got to think in a modern way - this is the digital age\". Ms soulsby said currently states accounts do not show what is spent on advertising and promotion. She said the states hoped to produce a set of accounts that were \"more meaningful and transparent\". The figures, from an access to public information request, showed in-house staff costs came to just over £397,000 for the time period. The cost of third party public relation companies was just over £300,000 with two thirds going to tourism marketing spend and other promotional work. The total cost for advertising was just over £1.1million, which includes legally required adverts. Nearly £800,000 of the advertising cost was for states recruitment and advertising purposes. Guernsey's states chief executive, paul whitfield, said £300,000 being spent on third party public relations firms would be subject to a states-wide procurement policy. He said civil service public relations roles could be changed to reduce costs for taxpayers. Adam riddell, chair of the chartered institute of public relations channel islands, said any organisation needed to justify its spend on public relations activity, and that justification needed to be based on \"whether that spend has produced the desired outcomes\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe guernsey states has spent more than £ 1.1 m on advertising and promotion in the past year.\n\n",

Thousands of border agency workers are expected to strike on 30 november in protest at government pension changes. Ministers fear there could be major disruption for travellers, so volunteers are being asked to step in. Pcs union chief mark serwotka said ministers were in a \"blind panic\" and should be resolving the dispute. The uk border agency has insisted the civil servants will be properly trained. It is expected they would mainly check the passports of travellers arriving from the european economic area and man so-called \"e-gates\" where passengers use their biometric passports. A ukba spokesman said: \"the security of the uk border remains our top priority and it is absolutely right we explore all options to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action.\" However, union chiefs expressed concern that the officials might not be properly trained and that borders could be put at risk. Mr serwotka, general secretary of the public and commercial services union, blamed ministers for leaving it so late to try and resolve the dispute. He told bbc radio 4's today programme that the call to civil servants was an example of \"blind panic\" at the 11th hour, he said, and accused the government of engaging in a misleading \"pr exercise\" about public sector pensions to try to force through \"damaging\" changes. \"instead of scratching around trying to put untrained people on the front line, they should say today they want urgent talks to try to resolve the dispute,\" he said. The government has confirmed earlier reports that ukba is planning to fly some officials home from overseas positions to help deal with the strike. In the wake of the recent row between home secretary theresa may and former uk border force chief brodie clark over the relaxation of controls during the summer, it is extremely unlikely that officials would be prepared to bypass any rules to ease the pressure of queues. The bbc has also learned that the government has told union bosses that they are not prepared to offer any further concessions over pension reforms as a result of the planned strikes. The government recently made what it describes as an improved offer to the unions, promising that public sector workers ten years away from retirement would not see any change to their pensions. It also promised improved accrual rates. Ministers fear that any further concessions would send the wrong signal to financial markets by suggesting that the government was not serious about cutting the deficit and making substantial savings in the public sector pension bill. Ministers argue that public sector pensions have become unaffordable because of rising life expectancy, but they insist that even after the planned changes, state employees will still be better off than the majority of workers in the private sector. Unions say their members are being asked to work longer, contribute more and receive less.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA union has criticised the government for asking civil servants to stand in for striking border officials.\n\n",

Lady mary soames, who died last year at 91, was the the last survivor of sir winston's five children. All but two of the paintings she owned have been allocated to the national trust and will remain at chartwell, churchill's family home in kent. The others will stay in the houses of parliament and the churchill war rooms. Lady soames wanted coast scene near cannes (1935) to stay in the commons and view from a bathing hut at the miami surf club, 1946 at the war rooms off whitehall in central london. The paintings have been accepted in lieu of inheritance tax. Churchill produced more than 500 artworks, many of them at chartwell, and continued his hobby well into his 80s. Lady soames previously wrote that \"painting literally grabbed\" her father in 1915, when he was 41, \"thereafter playing an increasing and abiding role in his life, renewing the source of his great inner strength and enabling him to face storms, ride out depressions and rise above the tough passages in his political life\".

The cartoon, by prominent artist jonathan shapiro, known as zapiro, also features a poem, which refers to mr zuma as a \"dick\". The latest row comes just weeks after the anc forced an art gallery to withdraw a painting showing mr zuma with his genitals exposed. Mr zuma is set to face zapiro in court in october over a different cartoon. The president sued the cartoonist, who works for the mail & guardian newspaper, after he depicted mr zuma in 2008 about to rape a female figure representing justice. Mr zuma was cleared of raping a family friend in 2006. The pair have also clashed over zapiro's portrayal of mr zuma with a shower cap on his head - a reference to mr zuma's statement in the rape trial that he had taken a shower after having sex to reduce the chance of contracting hiv. \"we find it unacceptable and shocking that after the harsh experiences that south africa, the president and his family has experienced few weeks ago, that zapiro and the mail & guardian will find it appropriate to continue with the insults and hurt to the president, his family and the broader anc constituency,\" the anc said in a statement. \"all south africans share our disgust.\" The painting in the gallery triggered a huge debate in south africa about the freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Before the gallery agreed to remove the painting, called the spear, it was vandalised by two men. In an affidavit, mr zuma said: \"the portrait depicts me in a manner that suggests i am a philanderer, a womaniser and one with no respect.\" Mr zuma, who has four wives, has previously sued local media companies 11 times for defamation.\n\nSENTENCE:\nSouth africa's governing african national congress ( anc ) has condemned a cartoon depicting president jacob zuma as a `` womaniser''.\n\n",

David davis rebuffed nicola sturgeon's calls for holyrood to be given powers over areas such as immigration as part of any deal with brussels. The conservative politician was in scotland a day after the scottish government published its draft independence referendum bill. He met his scottish government counterpart michael russell for talks. When asked if the first minister is being \"realistic\" with her demands, he said: \"they are both reserved powers. Immigration and international affairs are both reserved powers.\" Before the eu referendum in june, leading brexit campaigner and then justice secretary michael gove had suggested scotland could get powers over immigration as part of a deal to leave the eu. But mr davis said: \"it's hard to see how a separate immigration policy would work.\" He insisted the brexit arrangements would be a \"united kingdom deal\", rejecting the idea put forward by the scottish government that the country should be able to keep its place in the european single market. First minister nicola sturgeon has said a referendum will be called if it is felt necessary to \"protect scotland's interests\" in the wake of the brexit vote. But she has insisted her government was \"exploring all of the options\" for safeguarding scotland's place in europe, and has said she will publish proposals in the coming weeks for keeping scotland in the european single market even if the uk leaves. After his first meeting with mr davis, mr russell said he expected to soon be able to announce a formal process for scottish input into the brexit process. Speaking at strathclyde university in glasgow, mr davis said while it has \"got to be a united kingdom deal\", it would \"incorporate protection for the people of scotland\". He also said the eventual agreement would \"reflect the interests of the people of scotland\". Mr davis stated: \"the aim is to get the maximum possible barrier-free access to the european union market, as well as being able to get other markets globally. \"how we achieve that? We're not at that stage yet, but that's the aim.\" He continued: \"i don't think the scottish people want another referendum, but that's for them. \"i have simply got the single aim in front of me, which is to get the best deal possible, and that includes the best deal for the scottish people.\" Yesterday the prime minister of malta, joseph muscat, said that he thinks the united kingdom might actually rein back on brexit. Mr davis told bbc scotland that is not the case: \"that's not going to happen. The prime minister has made clear that the now infamous phrase'brexit means brexit' is going to happen. \"the people have given us an instruction, we have to carry it out.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe uk's brexit secretary has said scotland will not be given new powers as part of any deal with the eu.\n\n",

Reports suggest chinese buyers are acquiring the clothing retailer, which started in london in the 1850s. Its illustrious fans have included the queen mother, margaret thatcher and actors such as cary grant. But after the british firm was saved from administration in 2012, it has mainly focused on china and last year saw its uk sales fall 16%. Hong kong-based ygm trading, which bought it for £15m four years ago, said aquascutum is due to be sold in march 2017 to two buyers. The unnamed acquirers have made a $5m down payment for exclusive rights to the deal, ygm said in its annual report this week. Chinese textile firm shandong ruyi group is understood to be one of the buyers, according to bloomberg. Aquascutum started as a mayfair tailors in 1851, rising to prominence after its founder, john emary, patented the first waterproof textile. Its trench coats were worn by british soldiers during the first world war, while in 1953 its wyncol fabric - designed to withstand 100 mph winds - was used by explorer edmund hillary in the first confirmed ascent of mount everest. The coats were also a regular feature on the silver screen, with sean connery wearing one in another time, another place in 1958 and sophia loren in the key. However, the retailer has struggled in recent years, closing its nottinghamshire factory in 2012 and then falling into administration. Under ygm's ownership, the company's primary focus has been china, with 135 of its 146 outlets located in mainland china, hong kong, macau and taiwan. Last year it closed 14 stores in china amid declining sales, but opened one in europe. In the uk, its three remaining standalone stores are in westfield london, great marlborough street and jermyn street.\n\nSENTENCE:\nTrench coats maker aquascutum is set to be sold for about £ 100m.\n\n",

Swans boss paul clement said after his team's crucial 1-0 win over everton on saturday: \"it is a shame we can't bring all the fans. \"the players paying for the supporters' tickets came from leon britton and i thought it was a brilliant idea. \"that's been done by the players and led by leon and we hope they get up there safely.\" Fernando llorente scored the only goal as swansea's win combined with hull's defeat against already-relegated sunderland saw the welsh club climb out of the bottom three with two games remaining. Britton has not been a regular in recent weeks but started against the toffees, and clement added: \"leon was fantastic and he has been really great ever since i have been at the club. \"the fact he didn't play until the stoke game, yet remained so professional and supported the players and did that even when he was out the squad. \"he helped me as club captain. He came in, did his job and you can see he has a fantastic connection with the crowd.

Clement said the victory over everton has given his players a huge lift, but insisted the job is not yet finished. Swansea still have to travel to sunderland before facing west brom on the final day, while hull face relegation rivals crystal palace before entertaining tottenham hotspur. \"it was a fantastic win for us at this stage in the season, when the stakes are so high,\" clement added. \"i had a feeling the atmosphere would be good and i thought they were unbelievable today, getting behind the players against a really good team. \"we knew hull would play first and we said in the meeting that whatever happened, we needed to win. \"the message was we have an opportunity, don't waste it.

Michelle davies from law firm eversheds echoed concerns of employers' group, the cbi that the uk government decision to cut subsidies for renewables will damage investment and jobs. She said the welsh government missed the boat by not doing enough when subsidies were in place. Both government rejected the criticism. The uk government cut subsidies because it is already meeting its renewable energy targets, but ms davies told bbc radio wales that was \"not a sensible decision\" because it made the uk a less attractive place to invest. Ms davies said wales was not near where it should be on renewables, particularly when compared to scotland's \"strong leadership position\". \"we didn't create that environment initially and we're paying the price for it now,\" she told the wales at work programme. \"unfortunately there isn't a huge amount we can do about that now because the [uk] government sets the level of support that is provided,\" she said. A welsh government spokesman said it did not have the same energy powers as scotland, and defended its green energy record. The uk government said its priority was to move towards a low-carbon economy and ensure subsidies were used where they were needed most.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe welsh government is `` paying the price'' for not doing enough to promote renewable energy, a business expert has said.\n\n",

Herbert kilpin left nottingham to work in italy in the 1890s and later set up the club, becoming the team's first superstar in the process. Robert nieri has been fundraising for a plaque to go outside his birthplace to mark 100 years since his death. He said kilpin was the \"father of italian football\" and deserved more recognition in nottingham. You can read more stories about people who have helped shape sport on our pinterest board. The footballer, who was born at the back of a butcher's shop in mansfield road, started milan football and cricket club in 1899. Kilpin led the club to its first three championships and even designed its legendary red and black striped shirt. He died in 1916, aged 46, and his grave was believed lost until a historian tracked it down. In 1999, ac milan paid for a new tombstone and he was reburied in the monumental cemetery in milan. Kilpin's name adorns shirts in milan and his image can be seen on giant banners on match days. However, in nottingham, there has been little recognition of his achievements and writer mr nieri set out to change that. \"we need to bring kilpin to the fore,\" he said. \"he is the founder of one of the most successful clubs in the world and the father of italian football. \"he taught the italians to play. He's massive [in milan].\" On 22 october, the 100th anniversary of kilpin's death, a ceremony will take place outside his birthplace, and the sheriff of nottingham will name a bus after him. Mr nieri, whose book the lord of milan is set to be released, is also due to fly to italy to start filming a documentary about the star. The humble man who made milan. Details about herbert kilpin's remarkable life only started to emerge over the past few decades. How did a whisky-guzzling, chain-smoking son of a butcher from nottingham come to set up one of the world's biggest and most successful clubs? Other english ex-pats helped him, of course, but it is kilpin who has remained in the imagination here and in italy. While his friends became part of the fledgling italian football association, kilpin just wanted to play football. And that is why, according to some, he is a \"grassroots football icon\" - concerned only by what happened on the pitch. It is hoped more recognition of his story will inspire a generation of young footballers.

There will also be a week of new plays commemorating carnival at west yorkshire playhouse. Live updates and more from yorkshire. Additionally, it has been announced that an illuminated night carnival will kick-off the annual arts and light festival light night in october. A recreation of the sun goddess, the first leeds carnival queen costume, will be featured at the exhibition from august to october. The celebration of food, music and culture will culminate again in a parade through chapeltown and harehills. An estimated 160,000 revellers attended last year's carnival, organisers said. Arthur france initiated it after becoming homesick for his native st kitts and nevis. Mr france, head of the organising committee, said: \"when you come to carnival it is electric, so many things going on, beautiful costumes, beautiful colours, beautiful music.\" However, attempts to bring the parade into the city centre have been shelved. Mr france said he was \"very sad and upset\" at the council decision but added that it would not \"dampen my spirits\". Councillor judith blake, leader of leeds city council, said: \"a lot of events are happening on the bank holiday weekend and with the advice it just wouldn't be possible.\" Ms blake added: \"the oldest carnival in europe is here in leeds. We are so keen to make sure as a city we come together and everyone celebrates an incredible achievement.\" She praised mr france as a \"legend\" that had made \"an absolutely fantastic contribution heading up a brilliant team of people\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nPlans to mark the 50th anniversary of the oldest carnival in europe have been announced.\n\n",

Mr tucker will take over on 1 october, succeeding douglas flint who has been in the role since 2010. The appointment breaks an hsbc tradition of appointing insiders to the chairmanship. One of his first jobs will be to find a replacement for stuart gulliver, the chief executive of hsbc, who plans to step down next year. While hsbc is europe's biggest bank, the bulk of its profits are generated in asia. Mr tucker has been chief executive of aia for seven years, during which he oversaw the insurer's expansion in asia. Before aia, he was the chief executive of insurance giant prudential, and brings to hsbc his experience at the top of a uk financial giant as well as his asian exposure. Richard dunbar of aberdeen asset management, told the bbc the bank has \"obviously decided\" that an external perspective would be useful to hsbc at this time. He added that while chief executive of prudential, mr tucker did a good job of expanding its asian assets, which are seen as the firm's \"jewel in the crown\". Hsbc has been through an overhaul in recent years in an attempt to reverse declining profits. Over the past six years it has cut more than 40,000 jobs and sold off businesses. Despite those efforts, profits tumbled more than 60% last year. The banking industry has been hampered by the extended period of very low interest rates, which makes lending money less profitable. For hsbc, that problem has been compounded by its move into less risky areas of banking since the financial crisis which started in 2007. Those challenges make the appointment of a new chief executive even more crucial for investors, a search which will now be led by mr tucker. Hsbc has also been attempting to repair its image after a series of scandals. Earlier this year it reached a $470m (â£325m) settlement with the us government and states related to dubious mortgage lending and foreclosure practices during the financial crisis. In 2015 mr gulliver and mr flint apologised for \"unacceptable\" practices at its swiss private bank which helped clients to avoid tax. In late 2012 hsbc paid us authorities $1.9bn in a settlement over money laundering. Aia said that ng keng hooi, would take over as chief executive from 1 september.\n\nSENTENCE:\nHsbc has appointed the chief executive of asian insurer aia, alex tucker, as its new chairman.\n\n",

Mazembe made sure of the win having held their opponents to a 1-1 draw in algeria in the first leg of the final last weekend. They won the final 5-2 on aggregate, to add the confederation cup to their list of honours after winning the african champions  league in 2015. On sunday, mazembe went ahead in lubumbashi after just seven minutes through merveille bope who reacted quickest to a jean kasusula free- kick which hit the woodwork. Zambia international kalaba (pictured) hammered home a volley on the stroke of halftime to make it 2-0 and scored again just after the hour mark to put the result beyond the algerians, appearing in their first continental cup final. Bejaia scored a consolation goal in the 75th minute from sofiane khadir but the three-goal advantage was restored within 60 seconds by jonathan bolingi. Mazembe were eliminated early in the defence of their african champions league trophy this year and dropped down to the continent's second tier club competition. They will receive $660,000 following their confederation cup triumph with bejaia receiving the runners-up prize of $462,000.

The care quality commission (cqc) made a number of recommendations including ensuring nursing staffing levels were safe at sandwell general hospital and city hospital in birmingham. It also called for improvements in a&e, medical care and surgery. Sandwell and west birmingham hospitals nhs trust said it is \"working hard already to address the issues\". Care at the trust was given an overall rating of \"requires improvement\". The cqc said: \"the trust was rated as'inadequate' with regard to whether [it] was always providing a service that is safe.\" Source: cqc inspection between 14-17 and 25-30 october. The trust said the report made for  \"difficult reading\". Chief executive toby lewis said: \"the areas of improvement identified in the report are not a surprise to us at the trust, even where they are disappointing, or make difficult reading.\" Cqc's chief inspector, prof sir mike richards, said: \"while we witnessed areas of good practice it is clear that the trust has work to do to make improvements which are sustainable long term.\" Inspectors will return to check whether the necessary changes have taken place and the cqc will continue to monitor the trust \"closely\". Mr lewis said: \"during the cqc visit, inspectors saw some individual examples of poor practice in some departments around hand washing, security of medicines and completion of patient records.\" He said these individual examples \"are not acceptable\" and it is up to the trust leadership to ensure it gets \"the basics right, first time, every time for every patient\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nA hospital trust has been rated as `` inadequate'' by health inspectors.\n\n",

The nhs information centre data shows more than eight out of 10 newborns are now breastfed at least once after birth, up from six out of 10 in 1990. Experts said the increase was welcome and partly due to public awareness that \"breast is best\" for mother and child. But the figures do not reveal how many mums stick at it for the recommended first six months of a baby's life. Many women struggle to continue to exclusively breastfeed. And the royal college of midwives is concerned that some new mothers are not getting the support they need to encourage breastfeeding. Spokeswoman jane munro criticised the department of health in england for axing funding for national breastfeeding awareness week, which runs this week. \"we do not want to see the ground we have gained lost.\" She added: \"we know that many women stop breastfeeding when they leave hospital. \"this is why it is so important that they are able to get advice and support from their midwife, and that there are enough midwives with the time to offer these women the help they need.\" The government said it was committed to training up to an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015 who would \"be able to help support women who want to breastfeed but may find it difficult\". According to the latest figures, breastfeeding rates were higher in england than in scotland, northern ireland and wales, although rates have risen in most areas. And the percentage of women who are choosing to smoke either before or during pregnancy has fallen.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe number of babies being breastfed by their mothers in england has more than doubled in the past 25 years, figures show.\n\n",

In the aftermath of khalid masood's assault on london, the bbc received a number of questions from people concerned about safety and security on our streets. Here, bbc london's home affairs correspondent nick beake answers the most popular. Why don't the unarmed police officers at westminster have protective body gear, stab- or bulletproof vests? And do they carry tasers? Nick beake: pc keith palmer was an unarmed officer protecting the palace of westminster, but scotland yard says he was wearing a protective vest at the time of the attack. The force said during the post-mortem examination \"the pathologist could find no obvious evidence of damage or penetration other than the vest having been cut off during emergency first aid at the scene\". Armed officers working at parliament carry a primary weapon, a sidearm and a taser. And an unspecified number of armed response vehicles - three firearms specialists in an unmarked car - are on constant patrol in central london. Will the pavement safety barriers removed from nearby london bridge be restored? Nick beake: the use of safety barriers varies from location to location. The police, local authorities and transport bosses will all discuss where to install extra measures to protect the public. The mayor of london's office says it is currently considering where more barriers could be installed. Why not build a 6in [15cm] concrete barrier on the bridge pavements to protect pedestrians from the traffic? Nick beake: an independent review commissioned by the mayor of london, sadiq khan, last year recommended that more bollards be installed in busy parts of london to protect pedestrians from a nice- or berlin-style attack, where lorries were driven into crowds. The report author, lord harris of haringey, also called on the authorities to make more use of temporary barriers during big public events. What is the correct immediate response for members of the public caught up in this sort of attack? Nick beake: the current terrorist threat is rated as \"severe\", which means an attack is highly likely. The latest advice from the government is to run away from the danger, hide if that is not possible, and then tell the authorities: \"run, hide, tell.\" More information can be found on the gov.uk website. What should we do if we see something suspicious? Nick beake: if you spot something suspicious, ring the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789 321. And call 999 if you think there is an immediate threat. How do we know if something that seems suspicious is actually terrorism-related? Nick beake: it can be hard for experienced police and other investigators to establish quickly if a threat is terrorist-related, but the authorities would rather the public contact them with their genuine concerns however small they may be. It's better to be safe than sorry.\n\nSENTENCE:\nIn the wake of the westminster terror attack, the public have been asking questions about how we can be more protected.\n\n",

The 17-time grand slam champion beat france's gasquet 6-4 6-2 6-2 to give the swiss an unassailable 3-1 lead. \"this one is for the boys,\" said federer, who was in tears at the end of the match. \"this is not for me, i have won enough. I am just happy we can give everyone in our country a historic moment.\" Federer, 33, also paid tribute to compatriot stan wawrinka, who helped set up the victory in lille by beating jo-wilfried tsonga before partnering federer to win the doubles. Federer and wawrinka were involved in a row at the atp tour finals in london, which the world number two later described as \"heat of the moment\". \"stan has put in so much effort over the years. He played an unbelievable weekend and that is what gave me the opportunity today,\" said federer. Federer, who lost his singles rubber to gael monfils on friday, played an inspired match as he crushed gasquet, who replaced tsonga due to an arm injury. In front of a passionate crowd of 27,448 - a world record for a competitive tennis match - federer dropped only four points on his imperious serve in the opening set, which he sealed with a whipping forehand winner. World number 26 gasquet dropped serve in the first and seventh games of the second set, which federer took without conceding a single break point. He broke the frenchman twice in the final set to serve for the match and claimed victory with a deft backhand drop shot - collapsing in tears onto the clay at the stade pierre-mauroyto. The swiss win comes a week after federer pulled out of the tour finals title match against novak djokovic at the o2 in london to protect a back injury.\n\nSENTENCE:\nRoger federer produced a stunning display to beat richard gasquet and win the fed cup final for switzerland in front of a record crowd in lille.\n\n",

We aren't the biggest nation but we've probably underachieved,\" said the defender. \"i remember romania [1993] and the russia campaign [2003], the closer we get over the years, the more these questions seem to come. \"it's nice to be involved in the right sort of scenarios towards the end of the group. We played belgium when they celebrated getting to the [2014] world cup and we've put ourselves in that position now.\" Wales are a point clear at the summit of group b, with the top two teams qualifying automatically for euro 2016. Even if they lose their final two qualifiers - unlikely as andorra have never won a competitive game away from home - wales would still reach next summer's tournament if israel fail to win both of their remaining fixtures against cyprus and group favourites belgium. With the insurance of a home game against andorra on tuesday, the odds of qualification are overwhelmingly in wales' favour. But gunter is mindful of previous failures and says wales will be aiming to seal their place in france with a positive result against bosnia on saturday. \"the near misses are there as a reminder that in football even the most unlikely thing can happen until the job is done,\" he added. \"we've worked so hard for so long, it'd be a massive mistake to get complacent and think the job is done. \"if we start thinking we'll be celebrating on saturday night we'll be caught out. It's a really tough game. We have done well because we've always prepared in the right way. \"until we've qualified we have to concentrate as anything can happen.\" Gareth bale has been integral to wales' recent success, scoring six of their nine goals in this campaign, and a calf injury had made the real madrid forward a doubt for the forthcoming double-header. But he returned for his club side against atletico madrid on sunday and is expected to feature against bosnia and andorra. \"gareth is here, he's fit, he's done the same as everybody else. It's brilliant news for us and the gaffer [chris coleman] as well,\" said gunter. \"i don't think if he's fit and here we'll look beyond the game at the weekend. It'd be a brave man to tell him he's not playing saturday! \"if he's fit i'm sure he'll be involved and hopefully in the same form as the rest of the campaign.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nWales defender chris gunter says it would be a `` massive mistake'' to get complacent as they close in on euro 2016.\n\n",

Mole valley council will get â£21m from the developer barratt homes if the proposals go ahead. Nearly 2,800 people have signed a petition against the sale of the allotments. Campaigners say schools and doctors surgeries are \"already full\". Council leader chris townsend said the plans would provide more housing and financial support for council services. There are more than 100 plots at the barnett wood lane allotments. The authority has said more than 100 allotment holders would get new plots and is suggesting a split site with allotments on both the leatherhead and ashtead sides of the m25. Linda weller, from the leatherhead poors' allotment society, who organised the petition, said the council had tried to address most of the issues the society had raised. \"we do still have issues with what we're being offered, \" she said. \"we need time to go and assess both sites but we're slightly relieved that we're not going to the awful site that they originally dumped us on.\" She said wildlife, including at least one badger sett, would be disturbed. Allotment holder david wells said local schools and doctors surgeries were already \"rammed full\" and that the roads were \"a nightmare at the moment\". He added: \"as a resident for over 60 years i've looked out at the allotments and now to be faced with 500 houses and the development prior to that, well it's not good news.\" The campaign to protect rural england (cpre) surrey said it would continue to campaign to protect green belt land and open spaces. \"we are extremely disappointed by mole valley council's determination to dispose of a vital community asset and to allow building on adjacent green belt fields,\" the spokesman said. \"[the council's] approach to the barnett wood lane site indicates a failure to think strategically about the role of mole valley's countryside and green belt. \"it also shows a woeful disregard for the needs of local people.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nPlans to sell off allotments in leatherhead to build 500 houses have been approved by a council.\n\n",

Siale angilau, 25, died in hospital after being shot several times by a us marshal in front of the jury at the new federal courthouse. The fbi said he had rushed towards the witness with a pen in an \"aggressive, threatening manner\". Angilau was the last of 17 accused gang members tried as part of a 2010 case. The case included 29 counts, including assault, conspiracy, robbery and weapons offences. Perry cardwell, who was in the courtroom with his adult daughter, told the associated press news agency at least six shots were fired. \"it was kind of traumatising,\" sara jacobson, his daughter, said. The witness on the stand at the time was not identified and was not injured. He appeared to be in his mid-20s and was testifying about gang initiation, mr cardwell said. Us district judge tena campbell declared a mistrial, writing in her order that members of the jury were visibly shaken and upset. Angilau's lawyer declined to answer questions as he left the court on monday. The accused had been transferred to federal custody last week after serving time in prison in utah on other charges. The new federal courthouse in salt lake city opened just a week ago. It was designed with several security features, including bulletproof glass in some areas and separate routes in and out for judges, prisoners and the public. The building was closed for a while after the shooting but later reopened.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA judge has declared a mistrial in the murder trial of a utah man who was shot in the head as a witness gave evidence.\n\n",

A tractor laden with explosives was driven at a military police station, a statement said. The attack happened early on sunday near the town of dogubayezit in agri province, near the border with iran. Since 24 july, turkey has carried out hundreds of air raids on pkk bases on both sides of the iraq-turkey border. A turkish state news agency, anadolu, said the tractor was carrying two tons of explosives that were detonated by a suicide bomber. Turkey's army said in a statement that \"long-range guns\" were also found. Four of the injured were in a serious condition. The statement said the karabulak gendarmerie station was hit at around 03:00 local time on sunday (midnight gmt). Images in the turkish press showed a badly-damaged building with the roof destroyed. One report said the blast was so strong that houses in a village several hundred metres away were hit by debris and some residents were slightly injured. The dogan news agency added that militants also set up ambushes on roads to prevent medical teams getting to the scene. There has been no comment from the pkk so far. Afp news agency said it would be the first time the group was accused of deploying a suicide bomber during recent clashes. Turkey says the group was behind a number of attacks in the last two weeks:. Turkey's official news agency says about 260 kurdish fighters have been killed in strikes in northern iraq and turkey since 24 july. It has also targeted positions held by the islamic state group. At least six people were killed and several wounded in further turkish air strikes on saturday east of erbil, said local officials. The pro-pkk firat news agency described an attack on the village of zerkel as a \"massacre\". Iraqi kurdish president massoud barzani said: \"we condemn the bombing, which led to the martyrdom of the citizens of the kurdish region, and we call on turkey to not repeat the bombing of civilians.\" The turkish military on sunday said it had investigated the incident and dismissed claims that there could have been civilian casualties in zerkel, reuters reported. Turkey considers both the pkk and is terrorist organisations. The pkk has been fighting turkey for an autonomous homeland for the kurds. More than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since the pkk began an armed uprising in 1984. In 2012, the government and pkk began peace talks and the following year a ceasefire was agreed. However, the ceasefire ended in effect when turkey launched raids against kurdish separatist camps in northern iraq last month. The raids came after the pkk reportedly killed two turkish police officers in retaliation for an attack claimed by islamic state and what the pkk sees as turkey's collaboration with is.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA suicide bomber has attacked a turkish military police station in the north-east of the country, killing at least five people, the army says.\n\n",

In 2015/16, 93.3% of youngsters were in a \"positive destination\" three months after leaving high school. That was up from 93% in 2014/15. The scottish government figures also showed that those taking up training was 2.6%, down from 3.8% in 2014/15. The data is based on what happened to 52,249 pupils in s4 to s6 attending council-run and grant aided schools. Minister for further and higher education and science, shirley-anne somerville, said the statistics showed that the government was making real progress in enabling young people in scotland to realise \"their full potential\". She added: \"it is especially encouraging to note that the proportion of school leavers in our most deprived areas going on to a positive destination is at a record high. \"i am also pleased to note that the proportion of school leavers going directly into higher education has reached its highest ever level.\" The statistics also showed that from the 20% least deprived areas of scotland, 96.6% of former pupils were in a \"positive destination\". That is up from 95.1% in 2011/12. When looking at the 20% most deprived areas, the data shows that 88.7% of former pupils continued in education, got a job or secured training - that is up by 0.2% on 2014/15 and up by 4.8% on 2011/12. At a local authority level glasgow (89.9% of 4,551 pupils) and clackmannanshire (90.2% of 489 pupils) had the lowest percentage of pupils going on to \"positive destinations\" while na h-eileanan siar (97.6% of 248 pupils) and east dunbartonshire (97.5% of 1,368 pupils) had the highest percentages.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe proportion of school leavers going on to a `` positive destination'' in scotland has risen to its highest ever level.\n\n",

They provided information that would help find the \"truth\", mr fillon said. Last week investigators began a preliminary inquiry into reports she earned €500,000 ($534,000; £428,000) as her husband's parliamentary assistant. Le canard enchaine newspaper has questioned how much work she did for the money between 1998 and 2012. Both the centre-right candidate and his welsh-born wife deny any wrongdoing. In a statement, he said that the information they provided to police would prove the work done by mrs fillon. Mr fillon said last week he was \"outraged by the contempt and misogyny\" in the newspaper's story. He also said that he wanted to be heard by the investigators and would step down if put under formal investigation. The husband and wife were questioned separately by police specialising in financial crime, bbc paris correspondent hugh schofield says. The whole affair is causing serious jitters in mr fillon's centre-right republican party, he adds. They are hoping that the documents provided to police are enough to show that penelope fillon did indeed earn the money she received. Mr fillon, 62, is the front-runner for the presidential election in april. National front leader marine le pen and centrist emmanuel macron are seen as his main challengers. The practising catholic is an admirer of margaret thatcher and defeated the more moderate alain juppe in a landslide at party primaries in november.\n\nSENTENCE:\nFrench presidential candidate francois fillon has said he and his wife penelope have been questioned by police over claims she worked illegally.\n\n",

Greek officials had been expected to meet representatives of eu creditors in the greek capital athens on friday. But a european commission spokeswoman later said those representatives would arrive \"in the coming days\". Separately, greece formally submitted a request for a new loan from the international monetary fund (imf). In a letter to imf head christine lagarde dated 23 july but released to the public on friday, greek finance minister euclid tsakalotos wrote that athens was \"seeking a new loan\". Greece had initially planned not to ask the imf for more funds, reports say. Greek mps have approved tough new conditions set by the eu lenders for talks on the bailout. It is unclear when imf officials will be joining the negotiations. The washington-based imf wants greece's debt burden to be reduced to a level it considers \"sustainable\", but it faces resistance from reluctant european partners. Eu officials said on friday that there were \"logistical issues to solve\" before high-level talks with athens could begin, but that negotiations were taking place at a technical level. The greek team had been expected to meet top representatives from the european commission, european central bank (ecb) and european stability mechanism (esm) - the eurozone's main bailout fund. Talks on the bailout package are expected to last a month. Tight capital controls, introduced at the end of june, remain in place to prevent a run on greece's cash-strapped banks. Pm tsipras faced a backlash from mps in his own left-wing syriza party, during two parliamentary votes on austerity measures required by the creditors in order for negotiations to start. But he secured parliament's backing after a second crucial vote passed early on thursday. The reforms debated this week included changes to greek banking and an overhaul of the judiciary. Last week, greece passed an initial set of austerity measures, including tax rises and pushing back the retirement age. Mr tsipras has said that he is not happy with the measures imposed by creditors but that his government was forced to choose a \"difficult compromise\" to avoid greece exiting the eurozone. A decision on more contentious measures - phasing out early retirement and tax rises for farmers - has been pushed back to august. Demonstrations have taken place on the streets of athens against the bailout deal and trade unions have taken strike action. On wednesday, the ecb increased its cash lifeline to greek banks by €900m - the second rise in a week. The imf confirmed on monday that greece had cleared its overdue debt repayments of €2.05bn and was no longer in arrears. The repayments, which included €4.2bn to the ecb, were made possible by a short-term eu loan of €7.16bn. Greece's next major deadline is 20 august, when it must pay €3.2bn owed to the ecb, followed by a payment of €1.5bn to the imf in september.\n\nSENTENCE:\nGreek prime minister alexis tsipras has been given the go-ahead for high-level talks with eu creditors over a new € 86bn ( £ 70bn ) bailout.\n\n",

Bruce adamson also called on ministers to gather accurate data on the number of children who go hungry because they do not have access to free meals during school holidays. About 255,230 pupils are registered for free school meals in scotland. The government said it was \"taking steps\" to measure food insecurity. Mr adamson paid tribute to charities such as the trussell trust, which has begun a pilot project in glasgow to offer cookery lessons to parents struggling to make ends meet during the holidays. He told the bbc's good morning scotland programme: \"there shouldn't be stigma attached to having basic rights to food. \"the obligation is on the state to make sure that every child in scotland is getting access to the food, the education, the healthcare, everything that they need. And that shouldn't be a problem in the holidays. \"the more support we can provide to the trussell trust and to all of the different programmes right across scotland at community level that are delivering these important rights for children, the better.\" He added: \"it is a particular challenge over the holidays, which should be a time of joy and excitement and fun, but actually it is the most challenging time of the year for many families in scotland facing poverty.\" The scottish government introduced free school meals for all children in primary 1-3 in 2015. Since then, more than 77% of the 173,000 five to seven-year-olds that are registered take up the option of a free meal at school. However, the numbers registered falls significantly for subsequent age groups, with only 39,215 registered in p4-7 and 38,841 secondary school pupils entitled to a free meal during term time. A scottish government spokeswoman said that no child should be going hungry and that tackling inequality was a key government priority. She added: \"local authorities have the flexibility to provide meals to children outwith term time and some chose to use this flexibility during school holidays by providing holiday lunch clubs. \"in addition, we have already invested over â£350m in welfare mitigation measures, in addition to our â£1m fair food fund, which supports projects that promote dignity and harness the social potential of food to connect people and develop sustainable solutions to food poverty.\" She acknowledged that more work was needed to measure the numbers of children thought to be going hungry. She said: \"the scottish government has therefore taken steps to better measure the full range of food insecurity in scotland. \"three questions on food insecurity in scotland will be included in the scottish health survey 2017. Thereafter, the full united nations food insecurity question set will be included in the shs from 2018 onwards. \"this will allow internationally comparable baseline data on food insecurity in scotland to be available in 2019 with further data sets available annually thereafter.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nScotland's children's commissioner has said there should be no stigma attached to the right to food.\n\n",

The cumbernauld-based firm, which also makes rubicon and tizer, said it would cut irn bru's sugar content from about 10g per 100ml to just below 5g. It will reduce the calorie count per can from just under 140 to about 66. Ag barr said the move was part of a \"long-standing sugar reduction programme\". It confirmed in a stock market announcement on wednesday that more than 90% of its portfolio would contain less than 5g of total sugar per 100ml by this autumn. Tizer is already below that threshold, while the rubicon carbonates range will all have less than 5g of sugar per 100ml by the middle of this year, the company said. The uk government plans to introduce a levy on sugary drinks in april 2018. The soft drinks industry levy (sdil) will have two bands in the uk - one for soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml and a higher one for drinks with more than 8g per 100ml. Ministers hope the move will help tackle the nation's obesity problem. A spokesman for the company said: \"irn bru will still be made with sugar. We are not removing all the sugar, but we are reducing the amount. \"having worked on this for some time, we are carefully blending and balancing a mix of sugar, sweeteners and our original and best flavour essence to deliver the great taste of irn bru but with less sugar. \"we're doing this because evidence shows that most consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. \"86% of consumers are concerned about the amount of sugar in food and drink that they consume. \"that said, we have taken the soft drinks sugar tax thresholds into account when determining the levels of sugar reduction, but never compromising on taste.\" In the past year, the company has introduced two new drinks - irn bru xtra and rubicon spring - both of which contain no added sugar. Chief executive roger white said: \"evidence shows that consumers want to reduce their sugar intake while still enjoying great tasting drinks. \"we've responded by significantly reducing sugar across our portfolio in recent years, through reformulation and innovation. \"today's announcement builds on this progress and we are now expanding our successful sugar reduction plans to include our iconic irn bru brand.\" He added: \"we will continue to respond to our consumers and adapt to their changing preferences, offering great tasting products that are right for this generation of consumers and the next.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nIrn bru, one of scotland's best-known soft drinks brands, is to have its sugar content reduced in the wake of the uk's sugar tax.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. The new pay deal with the rugby football union (rfu) means an england international will earn up to £300,000 each year in match fees alone. Along with their club salaries, bonuses and commercial income, an elite player could soon top seven figures per year. \"the market place dictates what they deserve,\" rugby players' association chief executive hopley told bbc sport. \"if players are successful and conduct themselves in a way that is becoming to that role model status, then i think they do deserve it.\" The latest rfu accounts showed record profits following the 2015 rugby world cup. \"the players generate huge amounts of money for the game,\" hopley added. \"in the context of the revenues being generated through english rugby, it's a very reasonable deal. \"we wanted to ensure that the players felt they were participating in the commercial upside of the rfu - and despite a disappointing world cup for everyone, we have seen a fantastic year around english rugby revenues. \"england players in 2003 won £70,000 each for winning the world cup, while players in this old mutual wealth series will pick up more than that for playing in four games for england.\" Mark lambert, the vice-chairman of the rpa, denies that the new deal will lead to a disconnect between elite england players and the rest. \"the way you earn respect as a rugby player is the way you carry yourself, the way you behave, and the example you set for other people,\" the harlequins prop told bbc sport. \"all the [harlequins] guys that have come through the system and gone on to represent england internationally, they are model professionals and deserve what they have achieved in the game. \"we would all like to be earning that money, but it's something that's directly linked to the revenues of the rfu,\" added lambert, who has made more than 200 top-flight appearances for quins. \"the rfu make a lot of money and it's only right the england players get that. There is potential for players to make a good amount of money, but you have to put in that hard work first in order to get there.\" The rpa last week held its quarterly board meeting with a variety of issues on the agenda, from artificial pitches to the new rugby calendar. Hopley says the players' union would fully support the notion of a fallow summer in the calendar post-2019, as revealed by the bbc in september, adding: \"the players' voice is on the rise, and rightly so.\" Lambert said: \"it is more important than ever that the players have a strong voice. \"the game is expanding, there is a lot of money and there is lot of opportunity - and we need to make sure the player doesn't get pulled in too many directions. \"it's an exciting time, but we have got to make sure the game stays the same at its core.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nRugby's elite players deserve to be paid more, says the head of the players' union.\n\n",

Luke gale put tigers ahead, grounding a loose ball after salford failed to handle a high kick. Murdoch-masila's try reduced the deficit to two as gareth o'brien missed the conversion, but greg minkin powered over to extend castleford's lead. Murdoch-masila scored his second try to get salford within two points, before o'brien's penalty and drop-goal won it. Castleford had been top of super league before the game after winning their opening four matches, but wigan's draw with huddersfield means they fall to second in the table. Tigers are the leading scorers in the competition this season, but they struggled to break down a resilient salford defence. O'brien missed his first attempt at a drop-goal, but castleford knocked on from the restart to allow the former tigers loanee a second effort. His kick earned salford their third win of the season, taking them up to fifth in the early table. Salford head coach ian watson told bbc radio manchester:. \"i just thought our team mentality and our group unity in what we set out to do this week was brilliant. \"i thought our middles were phenomenal, they controlled our pack. \"he [ben murdoch-masila] is a tough kid and he's a great player as well, we just need to get him up fully fit now and get him running properly.\" Castleford head coach daryl powell told bbc radio leeds:. \"i'm disappointed, it was a poor performance. \"it was a tight game, conditions dictated a fair bit, but i thought we just went into ourselves way too much in the second half. \"it was just one of those games where we just couldn't quite get going, but i thought they played really well. \"if we'd have got a draw at the end it would have probably been a travesty, i thought they deserved to win the game.\" Salford: o'brien; johnson, welham, sa'u, j carney; lui, dobson; walne, tomkins, mossop, murdoch-masila, griffin, flanagan.

Jerome lavrilleux said the former president was not aware of the \"slip\". It comes after a lawyer for an event organiser accused the ump of ordering almost 11m euros ($15m; â£9m) worth of fake invoices to cover overspends. Reports say the scandal could damage the party and complicate any efforts by mr sarkozy to be re-elected. Police searched the headquarters of the ump in paris on monday afternoon. \"there have been anomalies,\" mr lavrilleux, a deputy director of mr sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign, told france's bfm tv. With tears in his eyes. \"there was no wrongdoing, there was a terrible spiral, a train going at high speed and people who should have pulled the emergency alarm and didn't, and i was probably one of them,\" he said. He said mr sarkozy, ump chairman jean-francois cope and batien millot, the founder of the events company bygmalion, were not aware of the actions taken. It comes after patrick maisonneuve, the lawyer for bygmalion, told the same television station that the centre-right ump had ordered fake invoices to cover exploding campaign costs. He said it was made clear to bygmalion that if it did not comply, it would not be paid. The ump's chairman was already facing growing speculation that he will have to step down after the french newspaper liberation reported this month that the party paid some 20m euros to a unit of bygmalion, founded by two associates of mr cope, to organise campaign events. Mr cope told bmf tv earlier on monday that he knew nothing of any wrongdoing. He said he had put his trust in the people who were responsible for the party's accounts and did not think he had to look over their shoulders. Mr cope was already expected to face challenges for the leadership of the party after the ump's poor result in the european parliament elections. It came second to the far-right front national. Mr sarkozy, who lost the presidency to francois hollande in 2012, is rumoured to be preparing to make a comeback in 2017. He has not commented on the scandal over his 2012 campaign finances.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe deputy director of nicolas sarkozy's 2012 presidential campaign has said his party's finances were in a `` terrible spiral''.\n\n",

The dscpa say two individuals attempted to ship the puppies from dublin port to holyhead port in north wales. The dogs were held in \"hugely inappropriate\" conditions, cramped into small containers with \"little or no space, no food or water\". The raid was part of operation delphin, a collaboration between animal welfare organisations and other agencies. The puppies are thought to be about six or seven weeks old and the breeds included beagles, basset hounds, labradoodles and pomeranians. They have now been returned to dublin and under dspca care. A number of them are ill and are undergoing veterinary care at a shelter in rathfarnham. The operation was part of an intelligence-led raid and involved the border force intercepting two vehicles on different ferry crossings. Ian briggs, of the rspca's special operations unit, said: \"these poor puppies were being carted into wales in deeply inappropriate conditions in the early hours of the morning. \"sadly, to unscrupulous dealers, these young pups are nothing more than a cash bonanza - and dealers would have been targeting tens of thousands of pounds from these shipments. \"this is another shocking example of people being readily prepared to act illegally and compromise the welfare of defenceless animals to make a quick buck - but, fortunately, they were stopped in their tracks.\" Brian gilles, ceo of the dspca, added, \"we are delighted with the outcome of this operation. \"we in the dspca believe that cooperating with agencies on both sides of the irish sea in sharing intelligence, resources and cooperating together will ultimately prevail against those who are involved in this disgusting, greedy trade.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA number of puppies have been seized in a `` shocking'' attempt to smuggle them into wales.\n\n",

Deliveries of the double-decker will now fall from 15 this year to 12 in 2018 and eight in 2019, airbus said. Chief executive tom enders said that prospects of further sales of the a380 in the short-term were not \"necessarily high\". Airbus, which has not had an a380 order for two years, makes the wings at its factory at broughton, north wales. The company said on thursdays that production of the a380 continued to operate at a marginal loss. In june, airbus unveiled an upgraded version of the world's largest passenger jet, promising greater fuel efficiency and room for more seats. Airbus hopes it will be the catalyst for more orders from airlines. Also on thursday, airbus posted second-quarter operating profits which fell 27% to 859m euros (â£765m) on revenues of 15.27bn euros. That fell short of the 910m euro profit expected by analysts polled by reuters. On wednesday, shares in rival boeing hit a record high after its second-quarter profit and cashflow came in well ahead of wall street estimates. Production at airbus has been hit by delays in delivery of us engine-maker pratt & whitney's engines for the a320neo aircraft. The fuel-saving geared turbofan engine has suffered reliability problems. On thursday, airbus chief executive tom enders said pratt & whitney had to \"work harder\" to fix the problems. \"it should be a winning engine but they need to fix it,\" he told reporters. \"pratt & whitney has introduced some fixes but we are still waiting for these improvements to come through.\" He also said that airbus was in \"constructive talks\" with qatar airways over a recent cancellation of four a350 aircraft, adding, \"i think we will find a way out\" of the issue.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAirbus has cut the number of a380 aircraft it plans to build this year because of delays in engine deliveries.\n\n",

Syd's garden will be \"laced with little clues\" about the singer, according to stephen pyle. Designed as a restful area for patients and staff, it will open in the grounds of addenbrooke's hospital in cambridge in 2018. Barrett, a founder member of pink floyd, died in 2006 after living locally as a semi-recluse. Read more cambridgeshire stories here. The garden has been designed by sculptor mr pyle and paul herrington, a garden designer. Their charity, art garden health, creates and maintains green spaces for nhs hospitals at no public cost. Addenbrooke's offered them a plot a year ago - and fundraising got under way. Mr pyle knew barrett as a young man when the two began saturday art classes at cambridge's homerton college. They were also members of band those without, which toured cambridge youth clubs and pubs between 1963 and 1965. They studied together at the cambridge school of art before barrett left for london - and mr pyle began a career in theatre set design. \"syd's sister said he liked roses,\" said mr pyle. \"and there'll be a striped colour theme, which fans will recognise. \"the artwork on his first solo album is turquoise and orange, and paul worked with those colours. \"there's also a nod to abbey road's crossing.\" The centrepiece will be a circular sculpture, depicting a teenage barrett on a bicycle, armed with a guitar and a paint palette. \"this was the syd i knew at art school,\" said mr pyle. \"the 18-year-old, the free wheeler. \"he wasn't ambitious for glory, just very creative and anarchic. He was very charismatic - and very, very talented.\" He described barrett as a \"celebrated son of cambridge\", who returned to the city and lived as a recluse until his death in 2006. In october 2016 a specially-designed artwork unveiled in the foyer of the cambridge corn exchange in october 2016, where he played his last live gig.

Synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies will take place in counties cork, meath, wexford, galway and dublin, beginning at 09:45 local time in cork. Thousands of people lined the streets of dublin on sunday for a parade to mark the centenary. The commemoration events have been organised by the irish government. The rebellion is viewed as a seminal event in the founding of the state. The easter rising was quelled within six days by british troops, but despite its failure it is seen as a significant stepping stone to the eventual creation of the republic of ireland and the partition of ireland. More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the fighting. A weekend of events to mark the centenary of the rising began on saturday with a remembrance ceremony in dublin at which irish president michael d higgins laid a wreath. Wreaths were also laid in dublin at kilmainham gaol, where 14 of the rising's leaders were executed, and at the sigerson monument in glasnevin cemetery, which is dedicated to to all those who lost their lives in the rising. The synchronised wreath-laying ceremonies on monday have been organised by the irish department of arts, heritage and the gaeltacht (irish-speaking areas). The locations and times are:. Then, at 12:30 local time, wreaths will be laid at various buildings and landmarks around the irish capital that became focal points during the rebellion. They include boland's mill, jacob's factory, dublin castle/city hall, the four courts, royal college of surgeons and moore street.\n\nSENTENCE:\nWreaths will be laid across the republic of ireland on monday to mark the centenary of the easter rising.\n\n",

His left-wing social democrat party (psd) had accused him of failing to carry out necessary economic reforms. The prime minister was involved in a power struggle with party leader liviu dragnea, who was barred from office after a conviction for voter fraud. Mr grindeanu lost the censure motion by 241 votes to 10. The decision by his own party and its liberal alde allies to oust him was seen as a first, even for romania's turbulent politics. For the motion to pass they needed a parliamentary majority of 233 votes. The psd won elections in december only a year after losing power. Within weeks, protests erupted across the country over a decree seen as weakening anti-corruption measures in one of the european union's most corrupt member states. In february the eu warned the government in bucharest against \"backtracking\" in its efforts against corruption. Although mr grindeanu withdrew the decree, the crisis weakened the new government and soured relations between the prime minister and mr dragnea. Mr dragnea criticised his rival's performance in government on wednesday, accusing him of failing to push through \"the most ambitious programme since 1989\". Some commentators have argued that his removal was more about relaxing measures aimed at tackling corruption. Mr dragnea, while being the power behind the left-wing party's throne, cannot take power because he was given a suspended jail term for vote rigging and also faces trial for alleged abuse of office. His first choice as prime minister, sevil shhaideh, was turned down by president klaus iohannis in december. A new nominee from the ruling coalition will also have to be approved by the president. Far from being the sick man of europe, romania's economy is showing the highest growth in the eu, at 5.6% in the year to march 2017. However, its justice system has been under eu scrutiny ever since the country joined in 2007. In its most recent report this year, the eu's executive praised romania's anti-corruption agency (dna) but warned that the fight against corruption was under serious threat from political and media attack.\n\nSENTENCE:\nRomania's prime minister sorin grindeanu has lost a vote of no confidence in the country's parliament.\n\n",

Her husband, arif yunus, was given seven years on similar charges. They have been in prison since their arrest nearly a year ago. Both still face separate charges of treason, which carries a life sentence. The couple say the case was politically motivated. Azerbaijan has repeatedly jailed human rights activists. President ilham aliyev has ruled azerbaijan since 2003 and has cracked down hard on political opponents. Both leyla, 59, and arif yunus are in poor health - she has diabetes and hepatitis c, while he has a heart condition and has suffered two strokes. Us-based human rights watch condemned their prosecution as a \"despicable political show trial\". Levan asatiani, an azerbaijan researcher at amnesty international, said \"the judicial system has once again revealed itself to be no more than a cynical tool by which president ilham aliyev crushes any dissent\". In a statement to the bbc the azerbaijan government said the court process in the case was \"open and free\". It also said \"the independence of judiciary and the rule of law have been fully guaranteed\" in azerbaijan. Leyla yunus was found guilty of fraud, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion and falsifying official documents. She is director of the institute for peace and democracy, a human rights group founded in 1995. It has worked with the council of europe - europe's leading human rights watchdog - and other international bodies, informing them about actions to stifle political dissent in azerbaijan. Mrs yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between oil-rich azerbaijan and neighbouring armenia, to defuse their frozen conflict over nagorno-karabakh. Armenian forces took control of the disputed territory in 1994 soon after the break-up of the soviet union. But sporadic clashes continue between them and nearby azeri forces.

Petersen was still there at the close on 105, with captain steven croft on 34, as the division one leaders ground out 298-3 from 96 overs in the day. Teenager haseeb hameed fell 11 short of a second successive championship ton on 89, while luke procter made 45. But the unbroken century stand between petersen and croft put lancs on top. Having so far put on exactly 100, they will resume on monday with a third batting bonus point looking a formality - and 14 overs to get a fourth. But, if they maintain their current pace of scoring, the division one leaders will not reach 400 by the time the all-important 110-over mark is reached. Hameed followed up his maiden first-class hundred against warwickshire at old trafford last week by taking almost five hours over his 89. But it was surpassed by the 41st hundred of 35-year-old south african test player petersen's first-class career. Lancashire cricket director and head coach ashley giles told bbc radio manchester:. \"we weren't quite sure what to do when we first turned up this morning. The pitch had a green tinge to it but in the end we decided to toss up and to opt to bat. \"we knew that pitches at lord's have been good in recent times so we went with that, and it worked out well for us. \"both alviro petersen and haseeb hameed batted extremely well. We are very lucky to have a number of youngsters who have come into the team and are performing well but we also need our senior players to pull their weight and alviro did that. \"we did not expect to be leading the first division at this stage,but there is a long way to go.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nAlviro petersen became the first lancashire player to score a century on day one of a county championship match at lord's.\n\n",

A spokesman for the judicial office said nick harrington had resigned with immediate effect. The anti-irish tweet appeared on the warwick district councillor's now deleted account during the eurovision song contest but was widely retweeted. Other tweets on the feed which \"may have caused concern\" are also being looked at, warwickshire police said. Police confirmed on sunday they were investigating the tweet, which contained offensive and racist language, and are treating it as a suspected hate crime. More from coventry and warwickshire. On monday, a spokesman said officers were aware of other tweets, posted on the same account, which may have caused concern. \"these will be considered during the investigation,\" the spokesman added. The leader of warwick district council, andrew mobbs, said he was also aware of other comments and it was up to a formal standards committee to purse all avenues before coming to any conclusions. Mr mobbs had already suspended mr harrington, who represents the stoneleigh and cubbington ward, from the conservatives on the district council for six months saying his behaviour was unacceptable. The judicial office said magistrates are required by the terms of their declaration and undertaking to inform their bench chairman and justices' clerk if they are subject to an investigation by the police. An advisory committee will then consider whether a conduct investigation is required. The national conservative party has suspended mr harrington, pending an investigation. The district council has said it will wait for the police investigation to conclude before deciding what, if any, action to take.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA warwickshire magistrate who posted an anti-irish tweet is being investigated by police.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. Koeman has advised midfielder james mccarthy not to join the ireland squad after previously saying he had been \"massively overloaded\" by the republic. Republic manager martin o'neill said this week that koeman was \"bleating\" about the matter. Keane added: \"maybe everton need to look at their own training schedule.\" Mccarthy, 25, has been ruled out of the republic's world cup qualifier against austria on saturday because of a hamstring injury. He has missed most of his club's season because of injury but played in the republic's qualifier wins over georgia and moldova last month. That angered everton boss koeman, who has only seen mccarthy play 33 minutes of competitive action for the premier league club since then. However, keane says he \"could not care less\" about koeman's concerns - and also criticised previous toffees manager roberto martinez. \"everton traditionally have always had brilliant irish players doing well for the football club, so they shouldn't be so quick to stop irish players coming to play for ireland,\" said the former manchester united midfielder. \"we have had a problem previously with martinez - i think he was slightly over the top. \"every time, we felt, the everton players were turning up - and this is not a criticism of the players, this is more from everton and their staff - they were always carrying knocks. \"i always felt the everton players were going to turn up on crutches or crawling in the hotel door, and now it looks like we are probably going to have that issue again with koeman.

The buglife conservation charity says the recent period of damp weather has seen the numbers of bees, wasps, moths and butterflies shrink in 2012. Its chief executive matt shardlow said that if the country keeps on having periods of damp weather, then it could prove dangerous for some rare species. \"they might not recover and could be driven closer to extinction,\" he said. This year saw the wettest april-june quarter on record and further heavy rain in july. Mr shardlow said the damp conditions have resulted in fewer aphids for wasps to feed on, which has reduced their numbers. It is likely to take two more years for their numbers to recover, he added. He also said the approximately 250 species of bees in the uk need high temperatures to gather nectar and pollen. \"we are seeing very low numbers of them now, as well as small bumble bees, which is a sign they haven't had enough nectar and pollen to feed on.\" Buglife says there is no specific data collated on various insect numbers, but that its volunteers and experts have been spotting numbers and will detect \"massive year-on-year variation\" which they have reported this year. However, some data is collated on butterfly numbers, and mr shardlow says that this year could see the lowest number of that insect ever recorded in the uk. Moths, too, are being seen in fewer numbers, he said. However, the wet weather has been good news for some insects, such as the crane fly, drone fly and mosquitoes as well as molluscs such as slugs and snails, which all thrive in the damp conditions. \"this means that anything which feeds on slugs and snails will also benefit this year,\" mr shardlow said. \"we've had reports of large numbers of glow worms, for example, which feed on slugs and snails.\" But richard ridler, chairman of essex beekeepers' association, says this year's bad weather has not necessarily killed off bees, just stopped them from venturing out into fields and gardens. \"the problem was that we had an appalling start to the year, which meant the bees stayed at home. Instead of going out, they stayed in their hives and ate their honey. I've had 25% of the honey yield that i would have expected this year. \"so the public saw a lot less of them. I haven't had beekeepers telling me that they've lost more bees than usual. \"this has been the most unusual, bizarre beekeeping year because of the weather. Most beekeepers i've spoken to have written this year off as an interesting experience, and one they hope not to have again for a while.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nThis year could be the wettest on record in the uk, experts have warned.\n\n",

Evidence of suspected match-fixing in elite tennis was revealed this week by a bbc and buzzfeed news investigation. \"future players will see the headlines and see it's not an option at all,\" doubles representative fleming told bbc scotland on wednesday. \"i think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again.\" Fleming, 31, and his partner jonathan erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the australian open on wednesday by robin haase and fernando verdasco. \"the key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,\" he added. \"you never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that. \"i've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; i certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.\" The scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the tennis integrity unit (tiu), set-up to police the sport. \"your guess is as good as mine,\" he said of those involved. \"there were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the tiu has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty. \"it can just be people throwing money on a match.\" Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in melbourne. \"i think if you're sitting at home or buying a ticket to come and watch here at the aussie open, i've no doubt in my mind you're watching pure sporting theatre,\" he said. \"players going at it and the best player winning on that day.

They also rejected a plan to introduce free parking for the first 30 minutes. The changes were proposed by four dup mlas, but infrastructure minister chris hazzard said their motion was based on \"seriously misguided logic\". He added that enforcing the 30-minute free parking system would be \"extremely resource intensive\". However, the assembly did pass a sinn féin amendment calling for a review of on-street parking arrangements which mr hazzard said he was \"minded\" to implement. \"i'm certainly not opposed to a review of sorts - a strategic review of on-street car parking policy and the direction of travel,\" the minister told bbc news ni. \"what i was opposed to, with the dup motion, was their pre-determined outcome of any such review, that we would set in stone before we began a massive reduction in penalty fines, i don't think that would be appropriate.\" The rejected dup motion was signed by ex-minister edwin  poots, and his party colleagues william humphrey, george robinson and alex easton. They said \"greater flexibility\" was needed in parking policy to encourage more trade in town and villages. Parking enforcement in northern ireland was privatised in 2006. Initially, fines were levied at £60, with the option of a 50% reduction if the bill was paid within a fortnight. However, in 2012, stormont mlas voted for the penalty to be increased to its current level of £90 - or £45 if it is settled within 14 days. The then roads minister danny kennedy said at the time that bigger fines would \"act as a greater deterrent to those who choose not to park properly\". The current minister said \"at least two thirds\" of people who receive parking tickets pay within two weeks, and therefore pay at the lower rate of £45. \"i think, when we look across many states, this is an appropriate amount, \"mr hazzard added. Last month, a belfast city council committee voted to end the council's annual policy of offering free car parking in the city centre in the run-up to christmas.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe northern ireland assembly has rejected a call to reduce parking fines from £ 90 to £ 45.\n\n",

At the end of his speech launching the party's manifesto, mike nesbitt said: \"domination doesn't work, partnership does.\" Ulster unionists want the election to be a referendum on how the renewable heat incentive debacle was handled. But the focus has now turned on them following mr nesbitt's comments. Mr nesbitt was asked about the decision of his senior party colleague danny kennedy to publicly distance himself from the remarks. He turned to mr kennedy, who was sitting behind him on the platform, and said: \"it wasn't disappointing, it was actually quite reaffirming to know danny was listening.\" The line brought laughter from other candidates and party members. Under questioning from journalists, mr nesbitt denied that he had any regrets or that he had made a mistake. \"what i have said consistently is vote ulster unionists and then for any candidate that you believe will do the right thing within your community, within your constituency and within the country,\" he said. He added that he \"wouldn't withdraw a word\" of what he had said and was thinking only of what what would happen after the election. \"the fact is, if we are going into [stormont] castle, it will be with a nationalist party,\" he said. \"now, would i rather go in with sinn fã©in or the sdlp? I would rather go in with the sdlp.\" Mr nesbitt went on to say that, on monday, he spent a lot of time time knocking doors in heavily unionist areas with \"very little criticism and a lot of support for what i was talking about\". \"i am confident in my position and i'm very confident and relaxed that [candidates] behind me are taking different positions in terms of vote transfer,\" he said. \"but people will come back on 2 march to thinking about the â£85,000 a day that is going up in smoke, the 10 years of the dup and sin fã©in in that castle and the impossibility, no matter what anybody writes in a platform piece for the newspaper, of leopards changing their spots.\" The manifesto, entitled'real partnership', includes calls for action in tackling waiting lists, increasing psni numbers to 7,500, prioritising the york street interchange, standing up for the lgbt community and \"guaranteeing\" that no group is worse off because of brexit. In a section entitled'cleaning up stormont', the party calls for:.

In experiments on mice, the stem cells were genetically engineered to produce and secrete toxins which kill brain tumours, without killing normal cells or themselves. Researchers said the next stage was to test the procedure in humans. A stem cell expert said this was \"the future\" of cancer treatment. The study, published in the journal stem cells, was the work of scientists from massachusetts general hospital and the harvard stem cell institute. For many years, they had been researching a stem-cell-based therapy for cancer, which would kill only tumour cells and no others. They used genetic engineering to make stem cells that spewed out cancer-killing toxins, but, crucially, were also able to resist the effects of the poison they were producing. They also posed no risk to normal, healthy cells. In animal tests, the stem cells were surrounded in gel and placed at the site of the brain tumour after it had been removed. Their cancer cells then died as they had no defence against the toxins. Dr khalid shah, lead author and director of the molecular neurotherapy and imaging lab at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school, said the results were very positive. \"after doing all of the molecular analysis and imaging to track the inhibition of protein synthesis within brain tumours, we do see the toxins kill the cancer cells.\" He added: \"cancer-killing toxins have been used with great success in a variety of blood cancers, but they don't work as well in solid tumours because the cancers aren't as accessible and the toxins have a short half-life.\" But genetically engineering stem cells has changed all that, he said. \"now, we have toxin-resistant stem cells that can make and release cancer-killing drugs.\" Chris mason, professor of regenerative medicine at university college london, said: \"this is a clever study, which signals the beginning of the next wave of therapies. \"it shows you can attack solid tumours by putting mini pharmacies inside the patient which deliver the toxic payload direct to the tumour. \"cells can do so much. This is the way the future is going to be.\" Nell barrie, senior science information manager for cancer research uk, said it was an \"ingenious approach\". \"we urgently need better treatments for brain tumours and this could help direct treatment to exactly where it's needed. \"but so far the technique has only been tested in mice and on cancer cells in the lab, so much more work will need to be done before we'll know if it could help patients with brain tumours.\" She said this type of research could help boost survival rates and bring much-needed progress for brain cancers. Dr shah now plans to test the technique using a number of different therapies on mice with glioblastoma, the most common brain tumour in human adults. He hopes the therapies could be used in clinical trials within the next five years.\n\nSENTENCE:\nScientists in the us have developed a stem cell therapy for brain tumours.\n\n",

John and elizabeth knott from bosbury, in herefordshire, were found dead at their home in august. Each had died from a single shotgun wound. A shotgun registered to mr knott, 71, was recovered by police at the scene. Assistant coroner roland wooderson recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for mrs knott, while finding mr knott intentionally took his own life. The couple's daughter elizabeth conway said she was shocked, but not surprised. \"mum didn't want to continue to live like that and dad couldn't see a life without mum,\" she said in a statement. The inquest, sitting at hereford town hall, heard mrs knott, 70, had been suffering from alzheimer's disease and anxiety. Friends described how mr knott had been devoted to his wife, known as anne, and had been upset when she attended a nearby respite care home. A couple of days after arriving at the care home, the inquest was told mr knott arranged for his wife to return home and two days later the couple were found dead. Relatives alerted police after becoming concerned about them. They were found in a workshop at the back of their garage. The door had been locked from the inside and the handle removed. Giving evidence, det sgt tim powell said there was no sign of any third-party involvement. The inquest also heard mr knott had been concerned by plans by travellers to move on to land next to their home.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA couple found dead in their garage were unlawfully killed, an inquest has heard.\n\n",

Most msps on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the marriage and civil partnership bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the church of scotland and roman catholic church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, labour msp margaret mcculloch, said: \"all of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. \"while the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the scottish parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience.\" The bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom french, of the equality network charity, said backing the bill would help remove discrimination from law. \"with just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage bill, we urge msps to stand up for a fairer and more equal scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support,\" he said. \"the large majority of people in scotland believe it's time lgbt people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are.\" But campaign group scotland for marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: \"the scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. \"real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of scots who don't support this law. \"no one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected.\" In england and wales, the marriage (same sex couples) act was passed into law in july. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to \"opt in\" to offering weddings, with the church of england and church in wales being banned in law from doing so.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA holyrood committee has backed plans to legalise gay marriage in scotland.\n\n",

Washington blamed russia and the syrian government for intensifying their attacks against civilians. Last week, the us warned it would halt the talks unless moscow stops bombing the city of aleppo. Russia said it regretted the us move, accusing it of shifting the blame for the collapse of last month's truce. Aleppo, syria's largest city in the north, has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the end of the ceasefire two weeks ago. The main trauma hospital in the rebel-held eastern part of the city was hit in an air strike for the third time in a week, activists said on monday. Hundreds of people, including children, have died since government forces launched an offensive to take full control of aleppo after the week-long truce lapsed. Some 250,000 people are trapped in eastern aleppo. In a statement, state department spokesman john kirby said: \"the united states is suspending its participation in bilateral channels with russia that were established to sustain the cessation of hostilities. \"unfortunately, russia failed to live up to its own commitments... and was also either unwilling or unable to ensure syrian regime adherence to the arrangements to which moscow agreed. \"rather, russia and the syrian regime have chosen to pursue a military course,\" mr kirby said, admitting that \"this is not a decision that was taken lightly\". He said moscow and syrian president bashar al-assad's troops had been \"targeting of critical infrastructure such as hospitals, and preventing humanitarian aid from reaching civilians in need, including through the 19 september attack on a humanitarian aid convoy\". Moscow strongly denies involvement of its own or syrian planes in the deadly aid convoy strike, and says the incident was caused by fire on the ground and not by an air strike. In response to the us suspension of the talks, russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova said: \"we regret this decision by washington.\" \"washington simply did not fulfil the key condition of the agreement to improve the humanitarian condition around aleppo. \"after failing to fulfil the agreements that they themselves worked out, they are trying to shift responsibility on to someone else,\" ms zakharova said. She also said that the us had failed to divide jihadist groups in syria from the moderate opposition. Russia and the us were due to convene in geneva to try to co-ordinate air strikes against jihadist groups, but american officials were told to return home. The us also said that it would withdraw personnel \"that had been dispatched in anticipation of the possible establishment of the joint (us-russian) implementation centre\". However, the two sides would keep talking about counter-terrorism operations in syria to avoid unnecessary clashes.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe us says it is suspending diplomatic talks with russia over the syrian conflict.\n\n",

Researchers from trend micro found blogs on the website had been modified to install malware known as cryptesla on readers' devices. The malware holds files on the host machine to ransom and demands a payment to restore them. The independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated. \"it appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware,\" said a spokesman for the newspaper. \"there is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this.\" The spokesman said the site affected was an old or \"legacy\" system that was now rarely visited. According to trend micro, the ransomware has been present on the independent blogs website since at least 21 november. \"we reported it to them on tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening,\" said raimund genes, chief technical officer at trend micro. \"now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours.\" The malware exploits a security hole in adobe flash player to install itself on a victim's computer.

The vulnerability in flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk. \"for a while on tuesday, the malware didn't trigger.

David cameron said a stadium would \"inspire young people, brings jobs and wealth\" to the county. Labour said it was a \"cynical\" attempt to distract voters, the liberal democrats questioned where the funds would come from, and mebyon kernow said it did not believe the tory's promise. Recent planning rows have left the future of the stadium in question. In march, cornwall councillors deferred a decision to grant permission to build a supermarket that would have paid for the facility, which supporters claimed had put the plans in jeopardy. Revised proposals for the stadium at west langarth are expected to be submitted to the council in may. Mr cameron said he planned to get the department of culture, media and sport to work with sport england, cornwall council and local sports teams to find a way to get it built. \"the stadium proposal is an exciting one. If it takes some extra money i'd make that money available,\" he added. However, stuart roden, labour candidate for truro and falmouth, said: \"this announcement today is a cynical empty promise and will come to nothing. \"it is simply more smoke and mirrors and people won't be taken for fools by this unfunded distraction.\" Simon rix, who is standing for the lib dems in the constituency, told bbc news: \"i'm massively in favour of a stadium in the right place if we can get the money. \"but it's like the conservative promises on the nhs, they're not saying where the money's going to come from.\" Stephen richardson, who is standing for mebyon kernow in truro and falmouth, said: \"you have to excuse me if i don't believe a single syllable of any david cameron promise during the election campaign.\" Click here for more information on the constituency and a full list of candidates.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe prime minister has said he will make extra money available to build a new stadium in cornwall.\n\n",

Nhs managers have proposed a temporary downgrade of the hospital's maternity and paediatric services to cope with staffing shortages. The board of east sussex healthcare nhs trust will make a decision on friday. One paediatric nurse, who asked not to be named, said staff were devastated for their patients. She said: \"it's going to mean that many more children will have to make journeys across to hastings at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. \"they're sick. Their families are vulnerable. And i think it's going to have massive implications for children who are sick and for children who are long-term disabled.\" The nhs trust said the changes were being brought in for safety reasons because it was unable to recruit suitable specialist doctors which had led to an over-reliance on temporary and agency staff. Several options are being considered, but the trust has said its preferred plan is to have consultant-led obstetric services, neonatal services including the special care baby unit, in-patient paediatric services and emergency gynaecology services at the conquest hospital in hastings. Eastbourne hospital would have a stand-alone midwifery-led maternity unit and enhanced paediatric care. Paediatrician dr david scott said: \"they [patients] will get a better service if they go to hastings because they will get staff who will be better trained. \"there will be greater consultant availability so they will see more senior better trained staff. It will also allow us to increase the levels of nursing care available on the ward.\" Liz walke, from the campaign group save the dgh, which opposes the changes at eastbourne, said: \"we would like an independent body coming in and looking at the whole organisation to see if they can do something better and actually reorganise the services so that both hospitals keep their core services.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nStaff at eastbourne general hospital have said they are `` devastated'' by plans to downgrade services.\n\n",

Johnston's goal put kilcoo 1-6 to 0-6 up early in the second half and was always likely to prove decisive in such a low-scoring contest. Kilcoo's lead was cut to a point but the down champions moved three ahead again and then held on. Scotstown duo francis caulfield and sub brian mcginnity were sent off late on. Caulfield was dismissed after getting a second yellow card while mcginnity saw red after appearing to strike impressive kilcoo full-back darragh o'hanlon. The monaghan champions, beaten by crossmaglen after extra-time in last year's provincial final, only had points from darren hughes and donal morgan to show for their early domination as several other good chances were missed. Kilcoo hit back with five unanswered points after aaron branigan opened up their account in the ninth minute. Conor laverty's typically busy display was crucial to kilcoo's improvement as donal kane, paul devlin (two) and martin devlin also notched points. After being held scoreless for almost 20 minutes, scotstown found their range again late in the first half as the lively shane carey pointed a free and keeper rory beggan also hit the target from a 45 after missing three earlier long-range efforts. Aidan branigan's departure at half-time looked a blow for kilcoo but instead his replacement johnston went on to become the central personality in the match. The sides were level at 0-6 a piece when johnston held his nerve to produce a great finish past beggan after laverty had flicked on a long ball. After shane carey's reply, johnston looked to have palmed in a second kilcoo goal but the effort was ruled out - harshly it appeared - for a square ball. The controversial decision looked as though it could be match-turning as another carey point cut kilcoo's lead to the minimum but crucially beggan and carey then missed chances to get scotstown on terms. Paul devlin's superb long-range point and an aaron morgan score, after more great work by laverty, left kilcoo three ahead with three minutes of normal time left and carey's seventh point was all scotstown could summon in the remaining eight minutes of action. In addition to johnston and laverty, niall branigan and darragh o'hanlon were among kilcoo's stars as they set up a meeting either kilcar or glenswilly on 30 october.\n\nSENTENCE:\nKilcoo produced a superb second-half display to beat 10-man scotstown 1-13 to 0-11 in the ulster sfc semi-final.\n\n",

In a speech marking the end of the islamic holy month of ramadan, he said iran still had sharp differences with the us, above all over the middle east. Iran would continue to back syria, iraq, the palestinians and \"oppressed people\" in yemen and bahrain, he said. The deal on iran's nuclear programme came after years of negotiations. The agreement limits iran's nuclear activities for at least 10 years in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions which have hampered the country's economy. \"whether the [nuclear] deal is approved or disapproved, we will never stop supporting our friends in the region and the people of palestine, yemen, syria, iraq, bahrain and lebanon,\" ayatollah khamenei said. \"even after this deal our policy towards the arrogant us will not change.\" The supreme leader also denied that iran was intending to create a nuclear bomb. \"the americans say they stopped iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\" he said in his speech at the mosala mosque in tehran. \"they know it's not true. We had a fatwa [religious ruling] declaring nuclear weapons to be religiously forbidden under islamic law. It had nothing to do with the nuclear talks. \"we have repeatedly said we don't negotiate with the us on regional or international affairs; not even on bilateral issues. \"there are some exceptions like the nuclear programme that we negotiated with americans to serve our interests... Us policies in the region are diametrically opposed with iran's policies.\" The supreme leader said it was now necessary for iranian politicians to scrutinise the nuclear agreement and make sure that iran's national interests were being preserved. Correspondents say that ayatollah khamenei's views are in contrast to the acclaim that the accord has received from president hassan rouhani and foreign minister mohammad javad zarif.\n\nSENTENCE:\nIran's supreme leader, ayatollah ali khamenei, has said the country's policy towards the us will not change despite the nuclear deal.\n\n",

It works by looking for a combination of \"markers\" in the blood which are different in healthy people and those with the disease. Delegates at the alzheimer's research uk conference heard that the university of nottingham is now developing a quick and easy test to do in clinics. It could mean much earlier diagnosis and better treatments, they said. The test uses some proteins that have been strongly linked with alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid and apoe. But through careful analysis of blood from people with the disease, as well as those with early-stage memory problems, the researchers detected some other markers that were suggestive of the disease. Most notably, some proteins related to inflammation seem to have been added to increase the power of the test. Prof kevin morgan from the university of nottingham said they still had to validate the test and it could be a decade before it was used in patients. But he added that the combination of markers they had found was looking very promising. \"our findings are exciting because they show that it is technically possible to distinguish between healthy people and those with alzheimer's using a blood test. \"as blood tests are a fast and easy way of aiding diagnosis, we are really encouraged by these findings and the potential they hold for the future.\" He said there were several ways the test could benefit patients, including giving people a definitive diagnosis, which was not always possible at the moment. It could also direct future therapies to make sure patients were getting the most appropriate treatment, he explained. Potentially, it could be a \"cheap and easy pre-screen\" test which enabled alzheimer's to be picked up before symptoms appeared, he said. \"the way we see it working is you can test people and it will tell them if they have the all-clear, or if they are medium- or high-risk. \"if they are medium-risk, they can be monitored closely and high-risk patients can be referred to a specialist for more in-depth testing.\" Dr eric karran, director of research at alzheimer's research uk, said: \"giving people with dementia an accurate diagnosis is not always easy, and so building up our armoury of diagnostic techniques is vital. \"while there is still some way to go before a test like this could become available, the results are promising. \"when used alongside other diagnostic techniques, a blood test like this could be a real help.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nScientists have developed a blood test which could help diagnose alzheimer's disease.\n\n",

The brewers - a non-league club until the 2009-10 season - finished second in league one this term to clinch promotion to the championship. Clough told bbc radio derby: \"it is frightening, but exciting as well. \"we will be underdogs in every game we play and favourites for relegation.\" Clough, who returned for a second spell in charge in december, first managed burton in the sixth tier of english football in 1998. He said the size of the club, and town, meant surviving against teams like newcastle, aston villa and nottingham forest would be incredibly tough. \"we have to find people who will want to prove people wrong,\" the 50-year-old added. \"it will be daunting but we will have to use everything we have used in league one to play like the underdog and try to attract characters that will embrace the sort of season it will be here. \"to come from crowds of 500 or 600 around 17 years ago, and to grow that ten-fold is remarkable in itself. It's not the biggest town - maybe about 70,000. \"this is a much more local fanbase and that makes it nice as well. Fans will get to experience championship football, something they never ever dreamed of.\" You can hear a full interview with burton albion manager nigel clough by clicking this link.\n\nSENTENCE:\nBurton albion manager nigel clough says it will be `` frightening'' and `` exciting'' to lead the club back to the championship.\n\n",

A \"terrorist hide\" was uncovered at capanagh forest near larne after two members of the public found suspicious objects in the woods on saturday. Some of the items found included an armour-piercing improvised rocket and two anti-personnel mines. The main line of police inquiry is the arms belonged to dissident republicans. Last week, home secretary theresa may said mi5 believed an attack on targets in great britain by dissident republicans had become \"a strong possibility\". Analysis: vincent kearney, bbc news ni's home affairs correspondent. The discovery of what appears to be a second dissident republican arms dump near larne within three months has left police baffled. Based on location alone, the analysis would be that the items found most likely belonged to loyalist paramilitaries. But the nature of what was found suggests otherwise and the finger of suspicion firmly in the direction of dissident republicans. Det supt kevin geddes said the threat level in northern ireland from dissident republican groups remains \"severe\" and an attack is \"highly likely\". Police officers found three barrels hidden in holes in the forest. As well as rockets and mines, there were also several pipe bombs, assault rifle ammunition and parts to construct a \"substantial number of explosive devices\". Det supt geddes said the seizure was significant \"both in terms of its size and its capability\". \"a number of these devices were ready to be deployed,\" he added. \"this seizure has undoubtedly saved lives.\" He said the type of weapons that had been found meant police would focus their investigation on dissident republicans. In march, an arms find was made at carnfunnock country park near larne, and police said the were investigating a connection between the two discoveries. \"there are links in terms of the general location and the manner and method of storage and packaging of these munitions,\" det supt geddes said. He added that police are \"indebted\" to the two people who noticed the suspicious objects in the capanagh forest.\n\nSENTENCE:\nPolice have said the discovery of an arms dump in county antrim could have `` saved lives''.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. Flower, 26, punched hohaia to the ground two minutes into saturday's grand final, then landed a second blow to his face while he lay on the ground. Wales prop flower was sent off as the warriors were beaten 14-6. The ban until 14 april takes in 10 super league games and the world club series match against brisbane broncos. New zealander hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before flower's punches. Flower was charged with a grade f offence - the most serious in the sport's disciplinary rules - of \"violent and aggressive punching\" and \"punching an off-guard opponent\", a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban. Wigan rugby general manager kris radlinski, who accompanied flower to the hearing at the rugby football league in leeds, said in a statement: \"wigan warriors would like to go on record in saying that the rfl disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity. \"we fully support their assessment of saturday night's incident involving our player, ben flower. We will be making no appeal. \"we would like to apologise to lance hohaia and his family and to the st helens club and fans. St helens' win on saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.\" In becoming the first man to be sent off in a grand final, flower left his side down to 12 men for the vast majority of the match at old trafford, which st helens won to end an eight-year wait for the super league title. Saints chairman eamonn mcmanus said: \"the sport of rugby league should not be judged by this event, but by how it deals with it. \"we must assist [flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and i am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.\" For wigan, the defeat ended their defence of the super league crown and the pursuit of a fourth title. Former wigan and great britain player martin offiah told bbc radio 5 live: \"there is a lot of emotion around what was a big occasion but sadly it was in effect ruined by this incident in which i believe both players played their part. It was a sad day for rugby league. \"the sport was on show, it's a big event and the pictures are very graphic and all the apologies in the world won't wipe these away. \"no one can condone that second punch to the head and he's apologised for that but lance hohaia must take some consideration for his actions.\" Meanwhile, greater manchester police said in a tweet they are investigating \"abusive social media activity\" surrounding the grand final.\n\nSENTENCE:\nWigan warriors will not appeal against the eight-game ban given to ben flower for punching st helens prop lance hohaia.\n\n",

Scottish natural heritage (snh), which has issued the advice, had previously heard complaints about \"significant problems\" with irresponsible owners. Farmers said some were unable to control their dogs around livestock and let the pets run through crops. The advice includes opening up less sensitive areas to dog walkers rather than trying to ban them completely. Drawing on the experiences of farmers and estate owners, the guidance also encourages landowners to explain why certain places should be avoided. The reasons include ground-nesting birds using the land and areas being used for rearing young lambs or calves. Nfu scotland, scottish land and estates, the kennel club and the scottish kennel club were consulted by snh. Bridget finton, snh recreation and access officer, said almost four million adults visited scotland's outdoors every year and about 48% of those people brought a dog with them. She said: \"these high numbers show how dog walking helps lots of people get healthy outdoor activity, but it's really important to minimise the number of occasions when dogs cause land managers' concerns. \"this guidance aims to influence the behaviour of the minority of dog walkers who act irresponsibly - actions that can have a big impact on livestock and wildlife, as well as those who are trying to enjoy the outdoors without getting dog dirt on their shoes.\" Gemma thomson, of nfus, said: \"nfus has been aware of increasing issues experienced by members as a result of dog access. \"there have been a number high profile instances which have occurred recently. \"nfus is pleased to support the guidance, which should go some way to helping some land managers in ensuring that they are clear about access rights, and also assist them in finding innovative ways to address issues where they occur.\" Anne gray, policy officer with scottish land and estates, said a variety of problems related to dog walking were reported to her every year. She said: \"these issues range from people not picking-up after their dog has gone to the toilet to dogs disturbing livestock, game birds or wildlife. \"we hope this guidance will give landowners, farmers and other land managers helpful tips on how to manage dog-walking on their land in a positive and effective way. \"we want everyone to have a good experience of being out and about in the countryside.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nLandowners have been given guidance on how to manage dog-walking on their land.\n\n",

Thick smoke has been billowing from the fire in slitting mill road in rugeley, staffordshire, since the blaze began on 5 september. The fire service said a controlled burn was taking place over fears water supplies could be contaminated. It is not known how long it will take to put the fire out.

Resident steve povey said he and others were also concerned about \"something toxic\" in the air that could affect people's long-term health, including his pregnant daughter. Alison shaw, manager of the nearby horns inn, said the pub's takings were also down because of the blaze. \"last week alone we have been down â£3,000... we're very angry about it.\" Mp for cannock chase amanda milling also said it was \"unacceptable\" the fire was still burning. The fire service said it was informed there was to be a two-hour controlled burn on the land on 5 september, but later received a 999 call to say it had got out of control. Dermot hogan, group manager of staffordshire fire service, said he was aware of residents' frustrations. Crews have been smothering part of the fire with soil, using foam to suppress the smoke and trying to remove burnt waste, he said.

The result was further embarrassment for michael o'neill's side after their 3-2 defeat by luxembourg last month. Paterson was among northern ireland players to miss great chances before the hosts scored two second-half goals. \"if you watched that game you're probably scratching your head wondering how have we lost 2-0. We are,\" he said. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"people might see the result and say'northern ireland lost 2-0, what a poor result that is' but they don't see how we've played. \"saying that, we've only got ourselves to blame. We dominated the game for 45 minutes but didn't take our chances and their goalkeeper played very well. \"then we just switched off for a couple of minutes, conceded, and the game changes. \"in the second half i hit the bar - it's a game of inches - and their second goal was just frustration.\" Another night of northern ireland ignominy ended with jonny evans being sent off for a crude foul, with mahir shukurov punishing the foul by netting the free-kick. After a night that proved a body blow to the team's hopes of a bright finish to their campaign, paterson still felt able to tentatively look on the bright side. With two points taken from a possible 12 against luxembourg and azerbaijan in the campaign, that might seem a stretch, but the 26-year-old gave it his best. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"there are positives to take, as mad as that sounds,\" said the huddersfield striker. \"i don't think we're miles away but it's a fine line. We had four or five good chances, they got one break and scored: that's international football. \"but we are still a young group. We've got to learn quickly and turn results around. \"if we do we have a chance of really pushing in the next campaign, but we have to work harder as a unit.\" Manager michael o'neill, who cut a frustrated figure in his post-match media duties, now faces the unenviable challenge of lifting a depleted squad for tuesday's final match in israel. Joining evans in being suspended for that match are defensive talisman gareth mcauley and midfielder oliver norwood, who each picked up their second bookings of the campaign. Northern ireland are unlikely to add to their squad in tel aviv, leaving o'neill to sift through his current group for answers. \"we have three players out but we also have men to come in - particularly the likes of sammy clingan and chris baird,\" added o'neill. \"we'll have to look at the centre-back situation because of the players we've lost to suspension and that is self inflicted.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nNorthern ireland striker david paterson said his side were to blame for their 2-0 defeat by azerbaijan in their final world cup qualifier.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. The world champions, who won britain's first gold of the london games in 2012, led from the start as they finished 1.2 seconds clear of new zealand in a time of seven minutes 18.29 seconds. Denmark finished third to take bronze. It was great britain's 17th medal of the games and moved them up to fourth in the table, ahead of australia.

Britain's 18th medal came just 20 minutes later as alex gregory, george nash, moe sbihi and constantine louloudis took victory in the men's four. Glover and stanning are now unbeaten in 39 races, a run that stretches back five years. They became the first british female rowers to win an olympic title when they won four years ago, but stanning said friday's victory in rio eclipsed their london success. \"this means so much more,\" she said. \"we have been so emotional this week and it means so much to us.\" Glover added: \"the pressure was immense. London was a home games and there was nothing more special but this is defending a title - it means so much.\" Find out how to get into rowing with our special guide. Glover and stanning dominated from the start, building up a 3.58s lead at the halfway mark. New zealand surged late on but the britons had enough in hand to take victory. \"i think they had another gear,\" said retired rower sir steve redgrave, who won gold medals at five consecutive olympic games. \"it is difficult to repeat what they did four years ago when they had a big lead because you have to keep going through the motions of it.\" Singer pixie lott: yessssss golden girls!!!!

The rac said the higher prices were due to a combination of rising crude oil prices, and the devaluation of the pound after june's brexit vote. Average petrol prices rose by 4.4p to 116.7p per litre and average diesel prices rose 5.2p to 118.7p per litre. The motoring body said these were the biggest monthly increases for three and a half years. Its fuel spokesman, simon williams, said retailers had \"no choice\" but to put up prices on garage forecourts. \"the effects of the weak pound have really been felt on the wholesale market, and this, combined with an oil price at nearly double its lowest level in 2016, has put significant upward pressure on wholesale fuel prices,\" he said. \"certainly, we are a long way from the remarkably low fuel prices enjoyed by families and businesses early in 2016, when the average price of unleaded was around 102p per litre and diesel was 101p,\" he added. According to the rac, the increases mean it now costs â£64.20 to fill the 55-litre petrol tank of a typical family car. Meanwhile it costs â£65.25 to fill up a similarly sized tank in a diesel car. The rac suggested that the price of fuel might stabilise in the coming months. \"opec, which represents some of the world's biggest oil producers, recently agreed in principle a cut in production,\" said mr williams. \"but a final deal is still to be agreed at an opec meeting at the end of this month and, with some analysts suggesting a deal might yet stall, this leaves open the prospect oil prices might stabilise or even fall before the end of the year,\" he added.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe price of petrol and diesel has risen by more than 5p per litre in the past month, according to the latest figures.\n\n",

Weaker commodity prices and consumer spending, together with a slowdown in its key trading partner, china, has hurt growth. Towards the end of last year, however, the economy expanded by just over 5%, boosted by government spending. President joko widodo had promised to lift annual growth to 7% on average. However, the country has seen an average of just under 6% growth over the past decade and analysts have said growth is unlikely to improve for some time. \"the fourth quarter data is a positive surprise,\" economist tony nash told the bbc. \"but unfortunately the uptick will likely be short lived. We expect deterioration in the first quarter and it'll be tough to regain growth momentum before 2017,\" he added. Mr widodo made his promise to raise growth when his five-year term began in 2014, but he has faced problems boosting government spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed. A $5.5bn high-speed railway project, funded by china, was signed last year and is scheduled to be up and running by 2019. But the project has faced widespread objections from transport experts and its long-term viability has been questioned. Mr widodo has also faced international condemnation for the country's man-made forest fires, which have caused serious economic and environmental damage. In december, the world bank said indonesia's forest fires last year had likely cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 aceh tsunami. In its quarterly report, the bank said the fires had cost some 221tn indonesian rupiah ($15.72bn; â£10.5bn). It added that regional and global costs would be much higher.\n\nSENTENCE:\nIndonesia's economy grew at an annual rate of 5.9 % in the last three months of 2016, its slowest pace since 2009.\n\n",

A feasibility study will look at options for a five-mile network linking the city centre and penarth, vale of glamorgan. The planned system would see passengers transported in gondolas along a route from cardiff central train station. Cbc chairman nigel roberts said it would carry 2,500 tourists and commuters every hour. He said: \"the great thing about cardiff bay is that when you get up into the air you can get a phenomenal view.\" If plans get off the ground, the gondolas would pass through the city's central square and cardiff bay before terminating in penarth. The scheme, which would cost about £20m per mile, could be funded from the welsh transport budget, the private sector and sponsorship, mr roberts suggested. He said funding may also be secured via the city deal - a measure designed to help the welsh economy grow - which chancellor george osborne announced in wednesday's budget. \"this would be a sustainable public transport method which would serve our growing city,\" said mr roberts. The cbc chairman was unable to say when the line could, if financially viable, be ready to carry passengers. \"i would certainly like to sit on this in my lifetime,\" he added. The news comes after cbc, cardiff council's inward investment arm, revealed it had also drawn up plans for wales' first commercial seaplane service.\n\nSENTENCE:\nPlans for cardiff bay's first gondola service have been unveiled by cardiff city council.\n\n",

Glamorgan's total was dominated by nick selman's mature 101 off 144 balls, his second first-class century. But seamers matt taylor and craig miles made sure wickets fell at regular intervals in cloudy conditions in the welsh capital. Gloucestershire struggled in turn as the bowlers remained on top all day. Selman's century, after being dropped on eight in the first over, was a welcome return to form for the brisbane-born opener after a string of low scores following his hundred against northants at swansea. Aneurin donald's quick-fire 36 off 30 balls was the next best contribution as taylor and miles prospered in the afternoon. Graham wagg and timm van der gugten scrambled glamorgan to a consolation bonus point. Gloucestershire's innings was a question of survival in the evening gloom, with the day ending evenly balanced. Glamorgan are being led by michael hogan for the first time in the absence of jacques rudolph, who has a neck problem. Glamorgan batsman nick selman told bbc wales sport:. \"it was good to get some runs for a change, the wicket was a bit slow and they bowled a bit short early on so i got through the first 25 overs and it got easier to bat from there, but it was a bit disappointing to get out just after i got a hundred. \"(my season) was going well up until after (a century in) swansea, after swansea four ducks in a row, but it was good to spend some time in the middle at northants. \"opening the batting in county cricket over here (in the uk), it's definitely hard, you get some good balls, you play on some green wickets and i was struggling a bit. \"i was happy to get a few today and hopefully i can continue that for the rest of the season.\" Gloucestershire seamer matt taylor told bbc radio bristol:. \"there's definitely a bit on offer out there (for the bowlers), we didn't start exactly how we'd like but we got there in the end and we'd take bowling them out for 220. \"i was pretty happy with that (hitting the stumps three times), the same plan as always is to hit the top of off-stump and luckily they missed them today. \"i was pleased to get an opportunity in t20 and the white-ball stuff this year, now i'm getting an opportunity with the red ball it's great. \"it's definitely going to be tough (for the gloucestershire batsmen), they're a good bowling attack but hopefully we can dig in and get to a reasonable score.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nGloucestershire bowled glamorgan out for 220 on day one of their county championship match at cardiff.\n\n",

Spencer wilding, who hails from rhyl, was the guest of honour at a special screening of rogue one. He had to muster all powers of the force to keep his vader role secret until the film's release. \"it's a hell of a secret to keep,\" said wilding, who was cast as the body actor for the role. \"but when you're a professional actor - when you sign that black and white sheet of paper saying you cannot say a word... I'm true to my word and i didn't say anything.\" Speaking to bbc radio wales' good morning wales programme, the 44-year-old said it proved a tricky task after rumours of the role leaked a year ago. \"i've been having hundreds of people every day for a year asking me if i'm vader,\" he said. \"if i had a pound for everyone who asked i'd be buying myself a new death star - and it'd be gold plated.\" The 6ft 7in (2m) tall actor already has a string of hollywood appearances to his name, including guardians of the galaxy, green lantern, three harry potter films and the tv blockbuster game of thrones. He said the vader role came from a regular casting call, first with a self-filmed tape, then a recall to pinewood studios. \"it's very, very secretive. We didn't even know exactly what the character was and what film it was until we got there,\" he said. \"i opened up the curtain when i went in the dressing room and there he was - vader. \"anybody out there who got into that costume and got an audition to be darth vader alone is very exciting, so to pull the character off as well, it's like'what!' \"i'm always pinching myself - i am definitely awake - it is not a dream, it is just another dream come true.\" While the actor has the body role, just like his predecessor in the original star wars films david prowse, the voice of lord vader is actor james earl jones. That did not stop wilding trying out the voice during filming. \"i'm not james earl jones - nowhere near him - but you know i got close to him i think, which helped the other actors - you know, you've got vader in front of you.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA welsh actor who plays darth vader in the latest star wars film has been honoured at the london film festival.\n\n",

The four are now in police custody, after a crime spree that included raids on hotels, small shops and amusement arcades, italian media report. On one occasion they allegedly raced off in a porsche cayenne after pointing a pistol in the driver's face. The gang reportedly boasted of their crimes in video clips on social media. They stole cash, smartphones, tablets and even on one occasion a youth's luxury shoes worth â‚¬530 (â£465; $601), according to police. The crimes took place in milan's quarto oggiaro district. Two of the young suspects are italians aged 14 and 16, the others are of foreign origin, aged 15 and 17. They came from broken homes and are thought to have been controlled by an egyptian man, aged 23. He is under arrest on a drugs charge and was convicted for previous offences. Police found that the youths - dubbed a \"baby gang\" in italian media - possessed several firearms, including a pump-action shotgun. Italy's rai news website said investigators \"stressed that the baby gang used brutal violence on their victims in the style of a clockwork orange\". One victim, a young man attacked in the street, was pistol-whipped and needed 10 stitches for a deep wound. The 1971 film a clockwork orange, directed by stanley kubrick, was a box-office hit.

At least two missiles were fired at a house in north waziristan tribal region early on wednesday, the deadliest drone attack in pakistan this year. It is the third such attack since new pm nawaz sharif won elections in may. He has demanded an end to such attacks. A government statement said the strike violated pakistan's sovereignty. \"pakistan has repeatedly emphasised the importance of bringing an immediate end to drone strikes,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said. \"they are counter-productive, entail loss of innocent civilian lives and have human rights and humanitarian implications.\" In a separate development, at least six security personnel are reported to have been killed and at least six more injured in an early morning attack by militants at a checkpoint near peshawar. At least two more are reported to be missing, possibly kidnapped by the attackers. Reports citing local officials said most of those killed in the drone strike were thought to be from the militant haqqani group. Officials say four missiles were fired by a us drone, targeting two houses and two vehicles, near miranshah, the main town in north waziristan. A number of other people were also injured. The haqqani network has been described by us military commanders as one of the most resilient militant groups operating in afghanistan. The troubled border region is a known stronghold for al-qaeda and taliban militants. Seven people were killed in a similar strike on 8 june, also in north waziristan, just three days after the new prime minister was sworn in. After that incident the pakistani government summoned a senior us diplomat in protest, condemning what it called a \"violation of pakistan's sovereignty and territorial integrity\". At least two key leaders of the pakistani taliban have been killed in earlier us drone strikes this year. Mullah nazir was killed in january and waliur rehman was killed in may, shortly after mr sharif swept to election victory. The bbc's richard galpin in islamabad says that the latest air strike by us forces will further heighten tensions between washington and the new pakistani government. Mr sharif has called for a joint strategy to stop us drone strikes. The issue is hugely controversial in pakistan, where parts of the government and military have often been accused of criticising the use of drones in public, but co-operating in private. Drone strikes are a source of severe tension between the us and pakistan. It is estimated that between 2004 and 2013, cia drone attacks in pakistan killed up to 3,460 people. About 890 of them were civilians and the vast majority of strikes were carried out by the obama administration, research by the bureau of investigative journalism said. Earlier this year, mr obama called the strikes part of a legitimate campaign against terrorism, but he also pledged more programme transparency and stricter targeting rules.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe pakistani government has condemned a us drone strike in north-west pakistan that killed at least 11 people, including a child.\n\n",

The grocer magazine reported that the firm is charging £2.64 for a 250g jar. It is the first supermarket to raise the price of marmite since the recent dispute between tesco and manufacturer unilever over the effect of the falling pound on production costs. A morrisons spokesman said: \"sometimes we have to increase prices as a result of costs rising.\" Unilever has raised the wholesale price of many household products, including pg tips tea and pot noodles, because falls in the value of sterling have increased the cost of products made outside the uk. The pound has lost nearly a fifth of its value since the uk voted to leave the eu in a referendum in june. It is the world's worst-performing currency on the global money markets this year. This makes imported goods more expensive because they continue to cost the same in dollars or euros, but the price is higher when converted into sterling. Morrisons said it did its best to avoid putting prices up. It added: \"more often than not we have been reducing prices and more than 3,000 products are currently cheaper in our supermarkets than they were last year.\" Tesco's row with unilever broke out earlier this month and has since been resolved, according to both sides. However, the grocer reported that both tesco and asda have raised prices on a number of unilever products, and morrisons has also increased the prices of other items made by the company. According to supermarket websites, a 250g pot of marmite costs £2.64 at morrisons, £2.50 at sainsbury's, £2.35 at both waitrose and tesco and is on special at asda for £2.\n\nSENTENCE:\nMorrisons has raised the price of marmite for the first time this year.\n\n",

Previously, trainee doctors had to wait up to four years to experience the consultation room. Gp live was developed by aberdeen university and uses streaming software to enter the consultation room. Researchers hope it will encourage more students to join general practice and help ease a recruitment crisis. The software will stream consultations just moments after they happen in an effort to give students a flavour of life as a gp. The system utilises one of the university's digitally enhanced learning spaces (dels), where students can engage in interactive learning with the aid of 55-inch display screens and state-of-the-art web conference tools. It was developed by dr john mckeown, a senior clinical lecturer and gp at cults medical group in aberdeen. He said: \"the biggest appeal for students is that they are seeing consultations that are almost live, and this adds a sense of immediacy that appeals to students who have grown up in an era where digitisation has made learning far more interactive. \"we aim to make the sessions as engaging as possible by discussing the gp's approach while the consultation takes place - for example how they communicate, the direction that they take the consultation, and of course their recommended course of action.\" Dr mckeown said that one of the main benefits of the system was that students and lecturers would be able to discuss consultations that have taken place at a variety of practices, where the issues could be very different. He added: \"this means that students get a real insight into the challenges facing gps who might operate in less affluent areas, or in remote rural locations. \"the system also allows us to work through a number of different consultations in succession, which very much mimics a typical morning for a gp. \"this allows us to see the range of skills - interpersonal, diagnostic and otherwise - that they bring to a normal working day.\" Dr mckeown said that by the time current first year students graduated there would be a pressing need for new gps in scotland.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA new system has been developed to allow trainee doctors to see their first live consultations.\n\n",

Anastasia deyeva, 24, has been appointed a deputy interior minister, unprecedented for anyone of her age. And some ukrainians think she is not qualified for the job. \"there's nothing wrong about a woman being an adviser, especially if she's pretty and smart,\" was one typical comment on facebook. \"but it's very wrong if she's that young and has no experience. Or the wrong kind of experience.\" As debate swirled around ms deyeva's appointment, another young woman was selected for the highly charged job of running a campaign to purge the government of corrupt officials. Anna kalynchuk, 23, studied law and was already part of the government's anti-corruption department. Ms deyeva had to deal with closer scrutiny than most public officials when nude photos of her were posted online. More tasteful pictures have since appeared on ukrainian lifestyle website style insider. Nothing to do with her work, insisted ms deyeva. She defended her credentials, telling one interviewer (in russian) she had exactly the right experience for the job. She was an aide to an mp, worked for a swedish energy company and was considered suitably qualified enough to be offered an interior ministry job in 2015. But her promotion to become ukraine's youngest ever deputy minster unleashed a torrent of criticism. \"i knew that i'd end up in the limelight, that there would be criticism and biased commentary. But i never expected such vile attacks,\" she says. Ms deyeva's boss, interior minister arsen avakov, is firmly behind her. \"the main thing people have against her is that she's young,\" he wrote on his facebook page (in russian), adding that the criticism was based on outdated attitudes. \"in the soviet tradition, this sort of job was for a monster, but we've hired a girl. Maybe so, only we do things differently in my ministry,\" he said. He is not alone in thinking it is time for ukraine to move on. \"i am extremely glad that you're one generation younger than me,\" wrote denis kazvan, formerly an interior ministry adviser. \"people like you do not need to spend 40 years wandering through the desert to get rid of the soviet gene of slavery.

The taiwanese firm, also known as foxconn technology, posted a net profit of nt$37bn ($1.2bn; â£814m) in the october to december quarter. It also reported a 16% jump in full year profit for 2012 to nt$94.8bn. Foxconn is the world's biggest contract electronics maker and apple is one of its biggest clients. According to some estimates, orders from apple account for almost half of foxconn's total revenue. In the october to december quarter, apple had sold 47.8 million iphones, up from 37 million a year earlier. Meanwhile, the launch of ipad mini, also boosted sales of its tablet pcs - it sold 22.9 million ipads, compared with 15.4 million in the same period in 2011. However, the heavy reliance on apple has also raised concerns that foxconn's growth may slow in the coming months. Some analysts said the rapid rate of growth that smartphones and tablet pcs had seen in recent years could not be sustained. \"in most of the developed economies, smartphones are at a mature penetration stage and tablets are pretty close to being at that stage,\" said andrew milroy of consultancy firm frost & sullivan. Mr milroy added that apple had so far not been able to replicate the success it enjoyed in the developed economies in emerging markets. He explained that in the emerging economies, apple products were still very expensive and out of reach for many consumers. At the same time, apple is facing increased competition from other smartphone makers in those markets. \"they are being hammered by low-cost smartphones in countries such as china,\" he said. The fear is that if apple's growth rate slows, it will have a knock on effect on suppliers such as foxconn.\n\nSENTENCE:\nTaiwan's foxconn has reported a 15 % rise in quarterly profits, helped by strong sales of iphones.\n\n",

The 45-55 vote marks the second defeat for republicans aiming to pass a bill this week to undo the health policy. The vote came a day after the senate rejected a plan to repeal and replace the health law with a republican plan. Senators will now consider a \"skinny\" repeal, which would scale back some of the more controversial provisions. The \"skinny\" plan would eliminate unpopular parts of obamacare - the affordable care act - including the individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance coverage as well as a tax on medical devices. If that measure passes, the senate and house of representatives would then be tasked with finalising a bill that could still change during negotiations. If successful, the full house and senate would again have to approve the measure. Seven republicans opposed the repeal-only plan on wednesday, which included a two-year delay on a replacement in the hope of finding agreement before that time elapses. The defeat is the latest blow for president donald trump, who put repealing obamacare at the centre of his election campaign, and underscores sharp divisions within the republican party over a replacement plan. A proposal to repeal and replace obamacare with the better care reconciliation act (bcra), a republican plan that was crafted over last two months, collapsed on tuesday night after nine republicans voted against it. Republicans have long railed against obamacare as government overreach, criticising the system for introducing government-run marketplaces, where premiums have risen sharply for some people. The party's proposed alternative included steep cuts to medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled. And it removes obamacare's individual mandate requiring all americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. About 20 million people gained health insurance under former president obama's affordable care act. The non-partisan congressional budgetary office (cbo) found the bill would strip 22 million americans of health insurance over the next decade. Other attempts to replace obamacare have failed in recent weeks due to republican divisions. In an early morning tweet on wednesday, mr trump lambasted republican senator lisa murkowski of alaska for opposing the party's plan, saying she \"really let the republicans, and our country, down yesterday. Too bad!\" Mrs murkowski was one of two republicans earlier on tuesday to vote against allowing the debate on healthcare legislation reform to go forward. But her party eked out a victory after vice president mike pence cast the tie-breaking vote which allowed discussion to take place. Senator john mccain, who was recently diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour, received a standing ovation as he returned to congress to cast his \"yes\" vote. President trump tweeted his thanks to the arizona senator for playing \"such a vital role\" in the vote.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe us senate has rejected a republican plan to repeal president barack obama's healthcare law.\n\n",

Tadashi ishii said he would tender his resignation at a january board meeting. Matsuri takahashi, 24, jumped to her death in december last year and in a note left for her mother, she asked: \"why do things have to be so hard?\". She had started working at dentsu in april 2015 and was soon doing an additional 100 hours a month. Dentsu has been under pressure to reduce the amount of overtime its employees do and in november it was raided by labour regulators. In september, the japanese government ruled that ms takahashi's death had been caused by overwork. She  would often return home at 5am after spending all day and night at the office. On wednesday, mr ishii, who has been chief executive in 2011, said: \"this is something that should never have been allowed to happen.\" While dentsu is attempting to curtail overwork - by turning off lights at the headquarters at 10pm - it admitted that more than 100 workers were still doing an extra 80 hours a month. Death linked to exhaustion in japan is so common that there is a word, \"karoshi\", to describe it. According to government figures, about 2,000 people a year kill themselves because of overwork.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe chief executive of japanese advertising firm dentsu has said he will resign after a worker killed herself because of overwork.\n\n",

The 31-year-old falcons academy graduate won three premiership titles with leicester in his nine years away from kingston park. Flood, who has been capped 60 times by england, said: \"when the opportunity came on to the table, it didn't take long for me to make the decision. \"it really feels like i'm coming home, and i've watched a fair amount of newcastle's games in recent months.\" Falcons, who have now made 10 signings for the 2017-18 season, did not disclose the length of flood's contract. Flood, who made his premiership debut for newcastle in 2005, spent six season with leicester where he went on to become club captain.

An early build of the new os, known as android n, was released on thursday for app developers to test. Google said it had released the beta software earlier than usual so that device manufacturers could get the finished version sooner. At the moment, fewer than 3% of android phones run the latest os, marshmallow. Typically, google discusses the next generation of its android os at its annual developer conference in the summer. But this year it has released a first draft earlier than expected. \"by releasing the first preview and asking for your feedback now (in march! ), we'll be able to act on that feedback while still being able to hand off the final n release to device makers this summer,\" wrote hiroshi lockheimer, senior vice president of android, in a blog post. On monday, google published statistics that showed an older version of android, lollipop, was still more widely used than the latest variant. About 36% of android devices run lollipop, with fewer than 3% running the newer marshmallow. But a range of new smartphones running marshmallow, from manufacturers such as samsung and lg, are due to be released. Android n will introduce split-screen multitasking that allows people to use two apps at the same time. Information can be copied across from one app to the other. A similar feature is already available on some ios and windows 10 devices, and samsung has already added the feature to some of its android smartphones. The new software also introduces some cosmetic changes to settings and notifications, and aims to improve battery life. Google has traditionally named new versions of the operating system after sweet treats, as was the case with lollipop and marshmallow. The newest version has not yet been named but it has been suggested that android n will be named after a popular chocolate and hazelnut breakfast spread. \"we're nut tellin' you yet,\" said mr lockheimer, possibly hinting at the name.\n\nSENTENCE:\nGoogle has begun rolling out the next version of its android operating system.\n\n",

It began in november but 20 cases have been notified in the last week and the total is more than for the whole of wales in the last three years. So far, 32 secondary schools, primary schools and nurseries are affected. Parents are being urged to make sure their children receive the measles, mumps and rubella (mmr) vaccination. The outbreak only affects the abertawe bro morgannwg university health board area and eclipses the number of cases across the whole of wales since 2010. Last year's figure of confirmed cases for wales stood at 116, while there were just 19 in 2011 and eight the year before, according to public health wales. There were 159 cases in 2009, still lower than the current outbreak in south west wales. Dr marion lyons, director of health protection for public health wales (phw), said: \"we continue to be concerned at the number of cases of measles we are seeing in the swansea and neath port talbot areas. \"we cannot emphasise enough that measles is an illness that can kill, or leave patients with permanent complications including severe brain damage, and the only protection is two doses of the mmr vaccination.\" She added that people most at risk of catching measles are children of school age who have not had two doses of mmr. Children should receive the first dose of the vaccine at 12 to 13 months of age and the second at three years and four months of age. Phw estimates there are more than 8,500 school children at risk of measles in the abertawe bro morgannwg area. Many people who catch measles will have a fever, cough, red eyes, and blocked nose and feel generally unwell. The blotchy rash appears a few days later beginning on the face and spreading downwards to the rest of the body over several days.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAn outbreak of measles in swansea and neath port talbot is putting thousands of children at risk, public health wales has warned.\n\n",

It reveals that those aged 60 and over are the fastest growing population in english and welsh prisons, with an increase of 146% between 2002 and 2014. Those aged 50-59 are the second fastest-growing group, says the report. The government said it was \"committed to providing suitable facilities\". The report comes as prisons minister andrew selous is due to give evidence on older prisoners to the commons justice select committee. Longer sentences mean more people are growing frail in prison, but high rates of social and support needs are unmet, says the trust. Two in five prisoners over 50 now have a disability of some kind, the report added. Trust director juliet lyon said: \"in the last few years, prison has been reduced to a punitive holding operation for people growing older and sicker behind bars. \"prisons are less safe and less decent than they were even a year ago when we published our last report. \"an incoming administration of government in may 2015 must not accept this deterioration in prison standards and conditions as the new normal.\" Although the prison population stands at around 84,500 in england and wales - 20% higher than it was 12 years ago - the national offender management service has had to make more than â£700m in savings over the last three years and is expected cut a further â£149m in 2014-15. The proportion of prisons whose performance is \"of concern\" or \"of serious concern\" according to the national offender management service has risen from 13% in 2012-13, to 23% in 2013-14. Prisons minister andrew selous, said: \"we're committed to providing suitable facilities and ensuring individual healthcare needs are met, as well as working alongside charities such as age uk and recoop to ensure older offenders are rehabilitated. \"from april next year, local authorities will be responsible for care and support for prisoners meaning that, for the first time, we will have a social care service working alongside the healthcare already provided in prisons by the nhs.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nPrisons are becoming a `` punitive holding operation for people growing older and sicker behind bars'', says a report by the prison trust.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. The leinster back-rower has been out for a number of weeks with a calf injury but has taken a full part in training since tuesday. Iain henderson starts in the second row as donnacha ryan has been struggling this week with a knee injury. Ian keatley is named as fly-half paddy jackson's understudy on the bench, which also includes winger tommy bowe. Media playback is not supported on this device. Ryan has been suffering from a niggling medial ligament injury and has not trained since tuesday. \"we wanted a bit more certainty about him but at the same time iain has done a super job for us in the past,\" explained ireland coach joe schmidt at the team announcement. Keith earls and simon zebo start on the wings. Regular number 10 johnny sexton was ruled out of the murrayfield match earlier this week as the calf injury he picked up in leinster's champions cup game against castres on 20 january has not yet fully healed. The 31-year-old has an \"outside chance\" of being fit to face italy in rome on 11 february, according to schmidt. Sexton's unavailability leaves ulster's jackson to make his sixth start in eight games for ireland, his last coming in the victory over australia in ireland's final autumn international in november. Munster flanker peter o'mahony is out with a hamstring problem so open-side o'brien joins blind-side flanker cj stander and number eight jamie heaslip in the back row. Andrew trimble's absence with a groin injury left earls and zebo as obvious choices to join full-back rob kearney in the back three, with bowe getting the nod among the replacements ahead of craig gilroy or tiernan o'halloran. Garry ringrose and robbie henshaw form the midfield pairing, with conor murray joining jackson to make up the half-back partnership. Up front, the front row combination of jack mcgrath, rory best and tadhg furlong is retained, while devin toner joins henderson at lock. Uncapped hooker niall scannell and his munster front-row partner john ryan are listed as replacements in preference to james tracy and finlay bealham. Bbc scotland's tom english. Ireland's team is formidable, despite johnny sexton not being in it. It's an illustration of their depth that donnacha ryan, a standout in the second-row in the victory over new zealand, can't now get into the 23. Jared payne and jordi murphy, two more heroes from that historic victory, are long-term injuries, but ireland are still loaded with class, power and experience.

He told fox news the democrats were putting out the reports because they were embarrassed at the scale of the election defeat. On friday, cia officials told us media they had concluded that russians hackers were trying to help mr trump. Russian officials have repeatedly denied the hacking accusations. Mr trump said it might have been russia but it was impossible to know. \"they have no idea if it's russia or china or somebody sitting in a bed some place,\" he said. President barack obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the democratic party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee hillary clinton. The contents of the emails, passed to wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the democrats and shook up the presidential campaign. Senior republicans have now joined democrats in calling for a full investigation. Republican senator john mccain, chairman of the senate armed services committee, said in a joint statement on sunday with top democrats that the cia's report \"should alarm every american\". He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the white house. In october, us government officials pointed the finger at russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process. But on friday, the intelligence community went further when us media reports said the cia had \"high confidence\" that russians were trying to influence the election in mr trump's favour. Russians had hacked the republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said. But mr trump told fox news sunday: \"i think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.\" He said the democrats were behind the news reports, not the cia, because they suffered such a big defeat. While backing the obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on russia but on other countries or individuals too. Republican party spokesman sean spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong. Mr trump also said in the interview he did not need daily intelligence briefings. \"i'm a smart person, i don't need to be told the same thing in the same way for eight years.\" Elsewhere in the interview, he said:. Mr trump, an outsider who stunned the political world by beating hillary clinton in last month's election, will assume office on 20 january. Why trump strikes a chord with russians. Russia's putin calls trump'a clever man' are there any trump links to putin?\n\nSENTENCE:\nUs president-elect donald trump has dismissed as `` ridiculous'' reports that the cia believes russia tried to influence the election.\n\n",

Judge aaron persky has been heavily criticised for giving student brock turner six months for assaulting an unconscious woman last year. Two other petitions have reached 115,000 and 175,000 signatures each. The petitions have no legal force but organisers hope they will increase pressure on politicians to act. Mr persky, a superior court judge in santa clara county, california, has reportedly received death threats in the wake of the case. The jail sentence he handed down to turner has been widely criticised as too lenient. Prosecutors had called for six years. Turner was seen by two other students sexually assaulting his victim, now 23, behind an outdoor rubbish bin. He tried to flee the scene but was caught and later admitted to the assault in court. Rights activists and members of the general public have accused mr persky of being influenced by turner's upbringing in a wealthy, white family, and his achievements as a college swimmer. The petition, posted on change.org, says that mr persky had \"failed to send the message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class, race, gender or other factors\". The judge said in his remarks that he was concerned about the \"severe impact\" a longer sentence would have on turner's life. Turner's father was also criticised after issuing a statement to the court saying his son was paying a steep price for only \"20 minutes of action\". Turner, who was a promising swimmer expected to compete for the us at olympic level, has been banned for life by usa swimming, the governing body for professional swimming in the us. The victim, who has not been named by the press, read an impact statement in court which was later read by millions. Us vice-president joe biden, who is involved in a campaign against campus assaults, wrote her an open letter praising her for her courage and saying he was \"filled with furious anger\" at the course of events. The cast of the tv show girls have also made a video backing the woman and other victims of sexual assault.\n\nSENTENCE:\nHundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition calling on a us judge to reconsider his sentence for a sexual assault case.\n\n",

The 24-hour industrial action is part of an ongoing dispute over staffing and the role of conductors. A strike planned for 4 april on southern routes was moved to 8 april after the company offered fresh talks. Merseyrail said coinciding a strike with the race meeting would damage liverpool's reputation. Speaking after its failed talks with the union on monday, merseyrail's managing director jan chaudhry-van der velde said the strikes would \"do immeasurable damage\" as the \"eyes of the world will be on liverpool\" during the grand national. Rmt general secretary mick cash said the \"cynical and hostile stance from merseyrail\" left the union \"with no option but to put on this additional strike action\". He said the rmt \"recognises the severe impact that the action will have\" but asked the public \"to understand that we have no option but to take this high-profile action to force the company back to the negotiating table\". Mr chaudhry-van der velde said the rmt \"has sunk to a new low\" by inflicting \"a barefaced attack on the reputation of our region\" on \"one of its proudest and most important days of the year\". Merseyrail has \"a range of contingency plans\" which would \"almost inevitably involve using buses to replace trains\", he said. Mr cash called on southern to \"get out of the bunker and to start making some progress\". He said rmt members on southern \"have shown incredible strength and resilience throughout the past year\" and \"have been clear from the off that this is not a dispute about who opens the doors\". \"it is a dispute about a safe method of operation and about the guarantee of that crucial, second safety-critical member of staff,\" he said. A southern spokesman said: \"we have received no official confirmation from the rmt and will review our response when we do.\" Richard allan, deputy managing director of arriva rail north, said he was \"surprised\" at the move as \"we had been in contact with their officials in the last 24 hours to organise further talks\". David sidebottom, director of independent watchdog transport focus, said: \"yet more strikes are being dumped on passengers who may have to cancel plans or endure miserable journeys. \"it is vital that all parties in this dispute get back around the table to resolve this matter without bringing the railway to a standstill.\" Up to 2,000 staff at southern rail, merseyrail and northern rail walked out on 13 march in the ongoing dispute but only limited disruption was reported.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA strike by merseyrail conductors on the same day as the grand national has been announced by the rmt union.\n\n",

Us carrier united airlines has said it will end daily flights between houston, texas and nigeria's commercial capital, lagos, on 30 june. It follows spanish airline iberia's decision to pull out in may. Falling oil prices have hurt africa's biggest economy, which has contracted for the first time since 2004. As a result of the foreign currency restrictions, airlines have been unable to repatriate up to $600m (â£417m) in ticket sales, according to the international air transport association (iata). Foreign currency reserves have dwindled to their lowest level in more than ten years and the government introduced a currency peg last year that has created a black market for the naira currency. \"the inability of airlines to access forex in africa's largest economy, if not solved, will affect air transport services to, from and within nigeria and undermine the country's position as west africa's aviation hub,\" iata said this week. Iberia said it was leaving nigeria due to \"very difficult operating circumstances and dwindling passenger numbers.\" Businesses operating in nigeria are struggling to get their hands on dollars, sterling or euros, says the bbc's west africa correspondent martin patience. The official exchange rate, which is controlled by the government is also very low compared to the black market rate. \"if you take $1, the official rate is 200 naira but if you then go on the black market where you will get the cash it can often cost you double that and airlines...simply can't go on the black market to get business done,\" says patience. Nigeria's economy contracted 0.4% in the first quarter of this year and last month nigeria's central bank governor said a recession appeared \"imminent.\" The central bank also announced plans to introduce a greater flexibility into the foreign exchange market.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAirlines in nigeria are pulling out of the country due to a lack of foreign currency.\n\n",

On one occasion there was only one commode available for more than 100 patients at north middlesex university hospital, a report by the watchdog said. Emergency services at the london hospital have been rated \"inadequate\". The hospital said it was \"extremely sorry\" for the problems in the unit. Inspectors from the care quality commission said there were too few competent doctors who were able to assess and treat patients at night when they inspected the department in april and may. The unit - which sees 500 hundred patients a day - logged 22 serious incidents in the past year, including the dead patient not being found for hours. Others included a patient being left sitting on a bedpan for more than an hour. And nurse to patient ratios were rarely achieved because they frequently had 20 patients being treated in the corridor. The report also said staff were afraid to speak up for fear of retribution. The inspection of the emergency department and two of the hospital's medical wards was in response to concerns about the standards of care. The hospital has apologised to patients and says the a&e department now has five additional doctors and consultants on loan from other london trusts, a new nursing lead and new clinical director. Chief inspector of hospitals sir mike richards said the hospital has already \"turned a corner\" since the inspection. He said: \"a new leadership team is in place in the emergency department, there are moves to appoint more senior doctors - and i note that the trust is calling on consultants from other departments within the hospital to provide the routine daily support to a and e which is so badly needed. \"there is still much more that needs to be done. We will be watching their progress very closely.\" David burrowes, mp for enfield southgate, said he was left to wait for 12 hours on a trolley with a ruptured appendix in the emergency department in 2014. He said \"urgent action\" was needed. \"the important question is why the warning signals from at least two years ago were not heeded,\" he added. Tottenham mp david lammy said the \"damning\" report is \"even worse than i feared\" and demanded answers from health secretary jeremy hunt. He said: \"it shocks and appals me that this situation has been left for so long without an intervention from the health secretary, and the way that this has been covered up is nothing short of a scandal.\" During the same inspection, medical care services were rated as requiring improvement. The trust is now required to improve the care of patients in the emergency department by 26 august 2016 following a warning from the cqc. A full inspection of the trust will take place in september.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA hospital where a patient died after being left on a trolley for hours has been told it must improve its a&e department.\n\n",

The ancient berry is from the same family of plants as potatoes, tomatoes and peppers. On the fossil, you can see the lines of the papery wrapping that grew around the fruit, which turned into coal during fossilisation. It was found in the patagonia area of argentina and researchers are hoping to find lots more plant fossils there. That's not the only place where old food can been found. We'd recommend you didn't eat these examples, which are all definitely way past their sell-by date! This huge 2,000-year-old lump of butter was found in a bog near drakerath in ireland last year. It probably wouldn't fit inside your fridge - it weighs as much as 10 large bags of sugar. Conditions in bogs are good for preserving things so the butter is in a good state, even though it's so old. It does, however, smell like strong cheese. We're not sure which would smell worse, this butter, or... last year, divers were exploring a shipwreck buried deep under the sea near sweden when they found this jar. They didn't know there was cheese inside until the journey to the surface caused some of the contents to leak, releasing a very strong smell. The stinky discovery was made when the team were investigating the wreck of the kronan, a warship that sank 340 years ago. Now that's taking mature cheddar to the extreme! In 2015, an american couple revealed they were still eating their wedding cake, 60 years after it was first baked in 1955. Ann and ken fredericks, from florida, decided to eat one piece of the fruit cake every year to celebrate the day they got married. They said their children were horrified at them eating such old food but insist that it still tastes as good as ever!

The prime minister has invited his german counterpart for a working dinner at his country residence, chequers. The wide-ranging talks also cover the threat of so-called islamic state, the situation in iraq and ukraine. Mr cameron earlier welcomed estonian prime minister taavi roivas to downing street for bilateral talks. The meetings with his european counterparts come on the day that a new campaign to get the uk to leave the european union is being launched ahead of the in-out referendum, promised by 2017. Vote leave, made up of conservative, labour and ukip mps and donors, says it wants to negotiate a new deal based on free trade and friendly co-operation. Mr cameron has pledged to reform britain's relationship with the eu before holding a vote on membership and will discuss his aims with mrs merkel as part of his continuing negotiations with european leaders. The pair will also discuss the migrant crisis affecting europe, as european countries continue to struggle to cope with the influx of people reaching the continent from the middle east and africa. Russia's bombing campaign in syria is also likely to be raised at the meeting, as concerns grow about moscow's involvement in the war-torn country - as well as its backing for separatist rebels in eastern ukraine. During talks with the pm at downing street, estonian prime minister mr roivas thanked mr cameron for the uk's commitment to send 100 british military personnel to the baltic region. Defence secretary michael fallon has said the troops will deter russian aggression beyond ukraine and reassure eastern european nato members. Speaking at a press conference on friday, mr fallon - who held talks with his us counterpart ash carter in london - said the uk government was committed to building support for air strikes against is in syria. He said russia's military action had made a \"grave situation even worse\".

The highly symbolic visit, mr xi's first since becoming leader in 2012, comes amid an increasingly tense political climate. Official celebrations are planned, as well as large protests from pro-democracy and pro-beijing camps. Several well-known activists were arrested on the eve of mr xi's arrival. The group, which included student leader joshua wong, had staged a protest at an iconic sculpture symbolising the handover. The golden sculpture of a bauhinia flower - hong kong's emblem - by the city's harbour was a gift from china. Mr xi arrived for the three-day visit with his wife peng liyuan at the city's main chek lap kok airport. The couple were welcomed by a marching band and children waving flags. In a brief speech on the tarmac, he said hong kong was \"always in my heart\". Beijing's central government \"has always been a strong backer of hong kong\" and \"will, as always, support hong kong's economic development and improvement of people's lives\". He also said beijing was \"willing to work with all sectors of hong kong's society in maintaining hong kong's extraordinary journey these past 20 years\", and would \"ensure'one country, two systems' will continue with stability\". The city was handed back from british to chinese rule in 1997. Beijing agreed to govern it under \"one country, two systems\", granting the city its own legal system, limited democracy with multiple political parties, and rights like freedom of assembly and free speech. But china's growing influence has been met with unease and concerns that the mainland could undermine hong kong's more politically liberal traditions. Activists have been campaigning for years for hong kong to have more political freedom. A series of official celebrations are planned for this weekend, as well as the inauguration of hong kong's incoming chief executive carrie lam. But parts of hong kong are under a tight security lockdown amid worries of further protests, with several major roads closed and sections of the city centre blocked off from the public. Thousands of police officers are being deployed across the city and along the route mr xi's motorcade will take when it enters the city. When former president hu jintao visited for the 15-year celebrations in 2012, he was met with hundreds of thousands of protesters, marching against what they saw as beijing's stifling influence on political reform in the city. Tensions spilled over into mass protests in the city centre in september 2014, with calls for full democracy and the resignation of then-chief executive cy leung.\n\nSENTENCE:\nChinese president xi jinping has arrived in hong kong for the 20th anniversary of its return to chinese control.\n\n",

The exercise was overseen by north leader kim jong-un, said the kcna state news agency, who called on the military to be ready to \"ruthlessly\" destroy the government in south. It is the latest in a series of angry gestures by pyongyang. The south's president park geun-hye has ordered the army to be on alert. But she said on thursday that \"reckless provocations will only become a path to self-destruction for the north korean regime\". North korea has been reacting after the un imposed some of its toughest sanctions following its nuclear and long-range rocket tests. Pyongyang has also been angered, as it is annually, by joint us-south korean military exercises taking place south of the border. Already known for vitriolic language, the kcna report threatened to turn the south's presidential residence, known as the blue house, into a \"sea of flames and ashes\". \"artillery shells flew like lightning and intensely and fiercely struck targets simulating cheong wa dae and rebel governing bodies in seoul,\" it said of the latest drill, using the korean name for the blue house. It was not clear when the drill was carried out, but the report warned of a \"miserable end\" for president park. The blue house was attacked by north korean commandos in 1968. The attempt to assassinate then-president park chung-hee was unsuccessful, but seven south koreans and most of the 31 north koreans attackers were killed.\n\nSENTENCE:\nNorth korea says it has carried out a `` large-scale'' military drill near its border with south korea.\n\n",

The review into 22 abuse cases in northern ireland criticised the authorities for not doing enough. The young people went missing a number of times over a 20-month period while being looked after in the care system. The police service of northern ireland (psni) said it has recently made policy changes aimed at keeping children safe. In september 2013, the psni said it had begun a major investigation into the sexual exploitation of children and young people who had gone missing from care in northern ireland. Officers said they had identified 22 people, aged between 13 and 18, who may have been sexually exploited. The psni investigation was known was operation owl. Thursday's report, examining the psni response, has been published by the safeguarding board for northern ireland. It said psni officers were effective in locating the teenagers and returning them to the care system. However, it found that they failed to properly examine the extent of the child sexual exploitation taking place and their attempts to find and stop the abusers was - in the words of the review - \"limited and inconsistent\". While there is praise for the help offered by some staff from residential care homes, stormont's health minister simon hamilton said that the report shows not enough support was given to protect the teenagers from harm or the risk of harm. He said the review had identified \"a significant gap\" in knowledge about perpetrators of child sexual exploitation. The head of the psni's public protection branch, det ch supt george clarke said that following operation owl, the psni has \"implemented a number of changes in our approach to handling this issue to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep children and young people safe\". \"indeed, in april of this year, the psni formed the public protection branch which is now responsible for policy and practice in relation to a number of areas including child sexual exploitation. \"the new structures enable us to work closely with our partner agencies in a much more cohesive way than before to ensure better protection and safeguarding for children and young people.\" The office said the psni has also revised its missing persons protocol, a joint policy with the health and social care authorities. \"this protocol is designed to support effective collaborative safeguarding responses by the psni and social services in respect of children who run away or go missing from their homes or care placements and builds upon developments in our knowledge and experience,\" mr clarke added. Last year, a separate review into the issue concluded that sexual exploitation was a growing threat to young people in northern ireland. That report also said that some abusers were thought to have links to paramilitary groups.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA police investigation into the sexual exploitation of teenagers who went missing from care was `` limited and inconsistent'', a report has found.\n\n",

Adrian brown, 38, experienced a \"severe psychotic episode\" when he stabbed muhammed ali on a london overground train on 12 december 2016. Judge deborah taylor qc ordered that brown should be detained indefinitely. She added he would only be released on the order of a judge or the government. Brown, of brockley rise, south-east london, appeared via video link from broadmoor hospital during the hearing. A jury found brown not guilty following a two-day trial at southwark crown court. He was also found not guilty, by reason of insanity, of possession of an offensive weapon and of assault by beating of mr ali. The trial heard brown had been delusional in his belief he would \"save humanity\" and exorcise a muslim demon haunting him by stabbing his victim. The court was told he was heard by other passengers to say \"where are all the muslims? I am going to kill all the muslims\", before holding a knife to the throat of another woman, who was unhurt. Brown accepted carrying out the attack but pleaded not guilty to a charge of attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. Mr ali had been travelling home with his wife when the assault took place between honor oak park and forest hill, south london. He told court that the attack had left him too frightened to leave his house. \"i struggle to sleep at the time because every time i shut my eyes i have flashbacks to the whole thing\", he said. \"i can only assume it was me because my wife was wearing a headscarf.\" Detaining brown indefinitely under section 37 of the mental health act, judge taylor said: \"you have a long history of psychotic illness and on that day you were suffering and you continue to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia. \"there's no doubt that if it had not been for the prompt intervention of an off-duty police officer and two medical practitioners that he he may well have died such were the severity of his injuries and the loss of blood.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA man has been found not guilty by reason of insanity of attempting to murder a muslim man on a train.\n\n",

The south of scotland facility shut last year despite a local campaign for its retention. A report to dumfries and galloway council said the new service was proving of a \"high standard\". However, it said changes to it systems meant \"direct performance comparisons\" were not possible. The dumfries site was the first of a number of control centres across scotland to be shut as part of plans to modernise the service. The union unison described it as a \"sad day\" for the town and more than 30 staff involved. A review of its impact has claimed that many figures could not be directly compared between the old service and the new one. It did find satisfaction levels were \"consistently above 90%\". The report also revealed that just nine out of the 34 staff affected now remained with police scotland. It concluded that the public and police officers in dumfries and galloway had benefited from the larger operating model and more modern it systems. Although it had been a \"significant change\", the report's verdict was that it had performed \"to the satisfaction of the public\". What do you think?

It will add an extra 600 seats a day for commuters into the welsh capital after being criticised for having too many overcrowded trains. Arriva trains wales, whose wales and borders franchise expires in 2018, is adding morning weekday services into cardiff central from barry and radyr. Economy minister ken skates had said arriva's profits were \"too high.\" The wales and borders franchise - which is one of the uk's most heavily subsidised, receiving between â£110m-â£160m a year - has seen passenger numbers rise from 18 million in 2003 to 30 million. About 265,000 people use cardiff central station weekly and a bbc investigation found overcrowding in cardiff stations during the morning commute was rising at a faster rate than anywhere else outside london, according to figures from the department for transport. Arriva trains wales now plans to add extra capacity and extra trains from 22 may on the following routes. Arriva trains wales said the additional trains were \"subject to railway approval processes\" but the announcement is \"one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade\". It said to implement the changes, the operator \"needed to remove one midday penarth service and one midday barry service\". The firm has a zero growth contract - which means it has the same number of trains it had when it began operations in 2003. It said the additions \"would not have been possible\" without network rail's recent â£300m signalling upgrade works and new platform eight at cardiff central. \"this is one of the most significant improvements to valleys commuters in a decade, since the opening of the ebbw vale line,\" said arriva trains wales customer services director, lynne milligan. \"with only a limited number of trains in our fleet and the lack of availability in the uk we have had to work hard to get the most from what we've got.\" Network rail wales said \"more trains are travelling through cardiff than ever before\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nTrain operator arriva trains wales has announced plans to increase capacity at cardiff central.\n\n",

Carl tremarco scored a well-worked goal on the break to give the visitors a half-time lead. That was extended early in the second period when miles storey's effort found the net via the post before josh meekings side-footed a third. Kris doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but jordan roberts notched a fourth for caley. It was an unusually abject performance from the glasgow jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left. Media playback is not supported on this device. The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for caley thistle boss john hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract partick players. One of them is steven lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by ryan edwards. Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at firhill since 16 january, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in maryhill. Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by andrea mbuyi-mutombo released tremarco. At first it seemed the englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot. Sean welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving owain fon williams in the inverness goalmouth soon after. Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley thistle immediately extended their lead when meekings found storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan swindon town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle. The firhill crowd got even more uneasy when roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by mbuyi-mutombo, then partick goalkeeper ryan scully had to pull off a great stop to deny storey getting his second of the afternoon. When roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos. Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from greg tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for inverness. Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding fon williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead. Richie foran - who has had so many injury problems over the last two years - came on as a substitute and delivered a cross for roberts to slam home at the back post and remind everyone which team had been in complete control.\n\nSENTENCE:\nInverness caledonian thistle eased to victory over partick thistle at firhill.\n\n",

Joel warwick also twice tried to kiss her and asked her to \"bend over\" a photocopier machine, the health and care professions council (hcpc) said. He denied misconduct and said it was mutual flirting at an east midlands ambulance service base in lincolnshire. The panel said his actions in 2015 were so serious it had to suspend him. The tribunal hearing on 4 april was told that mr warwick had removed a pen from the'v' of his colleague's blouse and squeezed her breast when he placed the pen back into her blouse. On another occasion mr warwick told the complainant he \"needed a hug\". He started working at the spalding station in august 2014 and claimed both he and his colleague had \"engaged in flirtatious behaviour\". In reaching its conclusion the hcpc said the panel acknowledged mr warwick was \"of good character\", with an \"otherwise unblemished career\". It also accepted that he had apologised to the complainant shortly afterwards. Panel chair claire bonnet said: \"mr warwick had demonstrated limited insight into how his actions transgressed professional boundaries. \"his misconduct was so serious that the need to uphold professional standards and public confidence in the profession and the regulatory process would be undermined if a finding of impairment was not made in these circumstances,\" she added.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA paramedic who squeezed a colleague's breast and asked for a hug has been suspended from the profession.\n\n",

On monday, the bbc's panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage. The mannin branch of the celtic league has called on the manx government to campaign for a full, independent inspection of the plant in cumbria. Sellafield says the site is safe and has been improved with significant investment in recent years. A spokesman added: \"safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.\" The isle of man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. Due to its potential impact on the manx fishing industry, the manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the irish sea in 1989. A government spokesman said: \"seafood fished in manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from sellafield to the irish sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.\" The bbc investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant. He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants. The manx government said it was particularly concerned about \"the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos\". A spokesman added: \"however we are content that sellafield ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation. \"the government has asked questions about the technical solutions being developed to decommission these redundant structures and representatives have visited the site to look at the work under way\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nCeltic football fans have called for an independent inspection of the sellafield nuclear site.\n\n",

Speaking during a parliamentary debate, philip hollobone said individual fireworks are extremely dangerous. But business minister jo johnson dismissed a ban and insisted current laws work well. The debate came after a petition to restrict the use of fireworks attracted more than 100,000 names. The petition, which called for restrictions on when fireworks can be used, was started by jill cutsforth, from beverley, east yorkshire, and julie doorne, from sleaford, lincolnshire in a bid to reduce stress and fear in people and animals. But, mr hollobone, mp for kettering, called for the government to go further. He said: \"i think there's great merit in saying all fireworks displays need to be licensed with a licensed operator, and frankly, amateur family-organised fireworks displays in people's back gardens are basically rubbish.\" Labour's angela smith, a member of the the environment, food and rural affairs committee, also backed the petition, arguing that restricting the number of days the public and organised events can set off fireworks should be restricted. She said: \"ideally, we would end the use of fireworks in back gardens. But i do understand the difficulty in delivering that as policy.\" Instead, she called for tighter regulations to govern how people use fireworks. Mr johnson acknowledged the concerns raised but said restricting their use to traditional holidays would be ineffective. \"it is likely that those who already use fireworks in an anti-social or inconsiderate way would not be deterred by further regulation,\" he said. He added: \"restrictions in use could lead to a drop in legitimate sales, leading to job losses not only in the firework industry but independent and associated businesses.\" Bracknell mp phillip lee also warned the debate that restricting the number of days that displays are permitted could reduce the viability of well-performing fireworks businesses. The government said following the debate it would continue to monitor the situation closely.\n\nSENTENCE:\nFireworks displays in back gardens should be banned, a conservative mp has said.\n\n",

Driver henry mcpherson, 61, from st fergus, died after the accident on the a952 near mintlaw in 2014. Pauline flynn, 36, denies causing death by careless driving. Mr mcpherson's partner patricia mcpherson, 52, told peterhead sheriff court she remembered the look of fear on his face. Ms flynn, of mintlaw, allegedly crossed on to the opposite side of the carriageway while driving along the clola to toll of birness road. Mrs mcpherson said: \"i became aware that i was to be in a crash when i saw lights cross from the other carriageway lighting up the central line, the driving line of the road. \"the lights were right in my face. \"the next thing i remember after that is a feeling like i was in a washing machine. \"it was a bit surreal. I felt like i was in a washing machine going round and round and can remember hearing myself screaming. \"and i can remember looking over at harry and he had a look of fear on his face that i had never seen in my life.\" Mrs mcpherson described mr mcperson as a masculine man who would not have shown anyone when he was scared. She went on: \"i think he knew it wasn't going to end well.\" Mrs mcpherson said her partner of 34 years, who was known as harry, had his arms stretched straight out in front on him on the steering wheel. She said she then felt as if she was being crushed from the front of her chest to her back and could  barely breathe. Mrs mcpherson said: \"i can remember being in the car and feeling crushed and i can remember a strange smell of earth or soil. \"i couldn't understand why i was smelling earth. I didn't at that stage realise the situation i was in. \"i didn't realise i was in a crash.\" Defence lawyer susan duffy asked mrs mcpherson if she wanted someone to be responsible for the death of mr mcpherson and her subsequent fracture injuries. She replied: \"i don't want anyone to be responsible for that no.

Mr kalashnikov had been involved in the \"anti-maidan\" protests in support of deposed president viktor yanukovych. It is not clear if he was murdered or committed suicide. Police say an investigation has been launched. At least eight yanukovych allies have died suddenly in the last three months. Most of the deaths are said to have been suicides. However, officials say it was possible some were killed or forced to take their lives. Commentators in ukraine have accused supporters, as well as opponents, of the current pro-western government of involvement in the deaths. The bbc's david stern in kiev says no motive has emerged linking the deaths and no arrests have been made. Mr kalashnikov was a former deputy in parliament and a member of mr yanukovych's party of regions. Accounts of his death differ, with some sources saying his body was found outside his flat in kiev and others saying it was found within. Mr yanukovych fled ukraine in february last year, after months of increasingly violent protests against him, centred on the maidan, kiev's main square. He later reappeared in russia. The government that succeeded him reversed his opposition to closer ties with the european union - a major factor behind the protests. It has since been plunged into a conflict with pro-russian separatist rebels in the country's east.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA prominent ukrainian activist, olexander kalashnikov, has been found dead in his flat in the capital kiev.\n\n",

I will keep on achieving and i know you will keep on hating. Damn, but who cares.\" It was for such provocative views that ms baloch was loved, derided and mocked. She instigated a debate in pakistan on whether choosing to defy family and societal norms symbolised women's empowerment or was cheap narcissism. In death, too, what police suspect is an honour killing carried out by her brother reflects a deeply divided country. On social media, some believe her brother was justified in killing her. \"a girl who decides to publish her naked pics for sake of publicity.... what her brother is sppose (sic) to do?\" Asked one islamabad-based twitter user. It was down to an mp, nafisa shah, to sum up the argument for the other side, writing: \"a social media star who exposed social hypocrisy is murdered by a family vigilante created by a skewed law. Condemnable.\" But others are blaming the media too, for publicising her private and personal information such as her passport and national identity card. When a former husband revealed she also had a child after a supposed love marriage, she claimed that it was forced on her at the age of 17, and that he used to beat her. Ms baloch genuinely feared for her life, even before she wrote an unheeded letter to the interior ministry calling for protection.

A bbc spokesman said books and authors were \"at the heart\" of the corporation. \"from dedicated strands like meet the author and talking books on the news channel, to radio 4's open book and radio 2's simon mayo's book club,\" he said. \"we show documentaries throughout the year like imagine: colm toibin (bbc one) and bbc four secret life of books and have recently launched our new online service, books at the bbc. \"we also run the bbc national short story award and children's writing competition 500 words on radio 2 and cover major literary prizes such as costa, man booker and the samuel johnson prize.\" Harris, though, told reporters the bbc should have \"a dedicated books programme\". \"i do wish the bbc in particular would fulfil that bit of its charter remit,\" he said. Helen macdonald's memoir h is for hawk was named costa book of the year on tuesday, beating four other finalists. Previously called the whitbread award, the â£30,000 prize aims to honour outstanding books by authors based in the uk and ireland.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe bbc should have a dedicated books programme, according to author neil harris.\n\n",

The staggies won the league cup and have secured a top-six finish. Mark warburton is in the running after steering rangers to the championship title, lifting the challenge cup and reaching the scottish cup final. Peter houston, whose falkirk side lie second in the championship, and jim mcinally, whose peterhead are third in league one, are also nominated. Part-time peterhead also reached the challenge cup final and still have a chance of promotion via the championship play-offs. Falkirk have reached the premiership play-offs and presently lead hibernian in the race to finish second in the second-tier table. Bairns manager peter houston told bbc scotland: \"i am thrilled that people have voted for me and it has come as a surprise. \"because i look at other managers and the resources they have and some wonderful jobs are being done.\" Mcintyre's county knocked holders celtic out of the league cup semi-finals before lifting the trophy for the first time. The county manager said: \"it was a big surprise as there are some fantastic nominees beside me and there also other managers out there who have had real success this season by winning their leagues and they have not been nominated.\" There is no place on the award shortlist for celtic's ronny deila, whose side are poised to win the premiership title - their fifth successive league triumph. However, the norwegian has already announced he will stand down at the end of the season after failing to win either domestic cup competition and having had poor campaigns in the champions league qualifiers and europa league group stage. Despite deila leading his side to a league and league cup double, last season's award went to john hughes, whose inverness caledonian thistle side lifted the scottish cup and finished third in the premiership - their highest-ever position ensuring a debut in european competition. The 2014 winner, derek mcinnes, also does not make the shortlist this time despite his aberdeen side posing the biggest challenge to celtic for a second year running in the top flight. Neither does allan johnston, who won the award in 2013 for leading queen of the south to the third-tier title and has done so again with dunfermline athletic, and gary naysmith, whose east fife side have won league two. Hearts head coach robbie neilson is another notable absentee, with his side sitting third in the premiership after winning promotion last season. Top 4:.

On 11 january, 32-year-old whittingham will have been with the bluebirds a decade, but his latest deal in the welsh capital runs out in the summer. It looks certain whittingham will commit his future to the bluebirds by signing a new contract. \"we'll talk about that before the fa cup probably,\" said warnock. Cardiff face fulham in the third round of the fa cup on sunday, 8 december, but before that, on monday 2 january, the bluebirds entertain whittingham's former club, aston villa in the championship. Back in 2007, then-cardiff boss dave jones, bought whittingham from villa for a fee of £350,000. Since then, the dead-ball specialist has established himself as one of the most popular players ever to pull on a cardiff shirt. He has been named in the championship team of the season three times and, in 2015, he was included in the football league team of the decade. Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the bluebirds. During his time with cardiff, whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the welsh club. This season he is currently the club's joint-top scorer in the league having found the net five times so far. But despite that, warnock says he will not be rushed into a new contract to keep the midfielder. \"that's the least of my worries at the minute. I haven't sorted my own [contract] out yet, let alone peter's,\" joked warnock. \"peter knows, i've said to him,'you'll be here as long as me peter' and he laughed and said, i know, that's what worries me. \"no, we've got a few days [before the fulham game] then we've got no league points to worry about so we'll probably have a chat during that period.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nCardiff city manager neil warnock says he will not be rushing into a new contract for midfielder peter whittingham.\n\n",

A spokesman said under new proposals, no-one younger than 18 or older than 75 would be allowed to climb. The ministry of tourism could also insist that all climbers have previous mountaineering experience. Nepal makes millions of dollars every year from the everest industry but has been criticised for poor management. In 2014, the mountain was closed after 16 sherpas (guides) died in an accident. And earlier this year, the climbing season was called off after a massive earthquake triggered an avalanche that killed 18 climbers. Over the past decade many people have sought to establish world records on the world's highest mountain, a practice the government wants to discourage. The youngest person to climb mount everest was 13 and the oldest 80. \"we don't think we should issue permits to people who cannot see or walk or who don't have arms,\" tourism department chief govinda karki told afp news agency. \"climbing everest is not a joke... it is not a matter of discrimination. How can you climb without legs? Someone will have to carry you up. We want to make the mountains safer for everyone, so we have to insist on some rules.\" Mr karki also said the government was considering only issuing permits to climbers who have already scaled another mountain above 6,500m (21,300ft). Over the years, everest has attracted many climbers aiming to overcome their disabilities. Last week, japanese mountaineer nobukazu kuriki, who had previously lost nine fingers to frostbite, abandoned his attempt to climb the mountain. In 2006, new zealander mark inglis, who had lost both legs to frostbite, became the first double amputee to reach the 8,848m (29,029ft) summit. Five years earlier, us climber erik weihenmayer became the first blind person to reach the top of everest.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe nepalese government has said it wants to tighten the rules on climbing mount everest.\n\n",

Broadband speeds in kingsmere, on the edge of bicester, rarely exceed 2mbps, and some homes cannot get a landline. Residents of the 400 homes have put up posters warning potential newcomers of the issue. Developer countryside properties said it had provided ducting for the cables but it was up to bt what went in them. Bt said it proposed sharing the â£45,000 cost of providing fibre-optic broadband. The development at kingsmere is part of the 13,000 homes planned by the government to turn bicester into one of a new generation of garden cities, announced earlier this month. Resident matt maunder said: \"i'm a home worker, and i need good broadband to do my job. We've actually got residents who moved here in august who still don't have a phone line - that's just unacceptable. \"i can't carry out my job effectively, i can't take advantage of services like skype, my family live abroad so i can't get in touch with them as easily as i would like. \"unfortunately we have got people now saying they wish they hadn't moved here because of the way the service is and that's a real shame, particularly because it's been lauded as the latest and greatest housing development in the country.\" Bt said it had reached an agreement for 726 additional homes yet to be built and a proposal for the existing houses would be ready by 10 january. Countryside properties said the ducting installed at kingsmere was based on a design agreed with bt in 2010, based on a copper network. A spokesman said: \"it is then bt/openreach's decision as to whether they would run copper or fibre through the ducting.\" Communications minister ed vaizey said: \"you wouldn't move into a brand new house in 2014/2015 and not expect to get superfast broadband.

The local authority has spent more than £750,000 on events since 2014. In total, 18 different organisations have received support for 38 events which attracted combined attendances of more than 160,000 people. The council report added that more than 43% of audiences had come from outside dumfries and galloway. The study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of the local authority's major festivals and events strategy (mfes). Among the events it has supported are wigtown book festival, spring fling and the dumfries and galloway arts festival. A survey found there was good public awareness of the strategy, with 85% of respondents saying the events benefited their community. The majority also said it had helped to provide a \"favourable impression\" of the council. The review concluded that the strategy had \"generally met its objectives\" in terms of supporting the development of the events sector in dumfries and galloway. \"the region is increasingly recognised for the breadth and depth of events across a number of sectors staged within its borders each year,\" it said. \"these contribute significantly to the regional economy as well as to the quality of life of our population.\" However, the study did flag up concerns about policing costs at some music festivals in the region. A meeting is to be held at the end of the month to try to tackle the issue.\n\nSENTENCE:\nDumfries and galloway council has `` generally met its objectives'' in supporting the development of the events sector, according to a new report.\n\n",

Mr beheshti died after being held on charges of \"actions against national security on social networks\". Following his arrest on 30 october, he was handed to police for interrogation and died on 3 november. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear. Some reports have suggested he was tortured. The tehran prosecutor's office says the main cause of mr beheshti's death could be physical shock - caused by the brute force applied to sensitive parts of his torso - or psychological pressure. \"it is not possible to determine the exact cause of death,\" it said in a statement quoted by irna news agency. \"but the most likely cause leading to death may be shock.\" The statement notes that a thorough forensic investigation has been carried out and that prosecutors have obtained witness statements from mr beheshti's inmates and prison wardens. Neither the statements nor the forensic results are in the public domain. An earlier coroner's report said his body had \"signs of wounds\" but no broken bones, according to the semi-official news agency mehr. Mr beheshti's death sparked an international outcry. Last week, three people were reported to have been arrested and subsequently, according to an opposition website, released. According to opposition website, kalameh, the suspects had been involved in mr beheshti's interrogation. Mr beheshti's mother has been forbidden to speak to the press. But an opposition website quoted her as saying she had been offered \"blood money\" in compensation. She added: \"i said i didn't want any. What i want is for the world to know that they killed my son. They killed sattar.\" It is thought mr beheshti was targeted for his writings on political and social issues on his blog and on facebook. The blogger spent one night in tehran's notorious evin prison on 30 october, where he wrote an official complaint to prison authorities alleging ill-treatment, before being moved to an unknown location. His death provoked criticism from politicians and human rights groups, amnesty international said mr beheshti had complained of being threatened the day before his arrest.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA coroner's report into the death of iranian blogger sattar beheshti has concluded that he died of shock.\n\n",

Media playback is not supported on this device. Amy wilson hardy went over in the corner as england scored from their only chance in the first half. Ireland could not breach england's solid defence and were made to pay as the world champions ran in four tries. Forwards laura keates and amy cokayne extended the visitors' lead before backs emily scarratt and lydia thompson rounded off the win with fine tries. With the under-20 men's side having won a grand slam earlier on friday, england's men will look to complete a hat-trick by beating ireland in dublin on saturday. The women, who return to ireland in the summer to defend their world title, have won their first six nations title since 2012. Wing wilson hardy completed a fine england move in the 16th minute, but then ireland dominated play. Centre sene naoupu came within a metre of going over but was stopped by a superb tackle from flanker marlie packer, and home captain paula fitzpatrick was prevented from touching down by a posse of england players. England regrouped after half-time and extended their lead when replacement prop keates drove over the line from two metres out. Ireland were reduced to 14 players two minutes before the hour when substitute mairead coyne made a deliberate knock-on. Hooker cokayne burst through to increase england's advantage but ireland hooker leah lyons responded to give ireland hope. However, scarratt finished off an excellent england move to put the result beyond doubt and then replacement winger thompson showed her pace to score england's fifth try. Ireland: flood, tyrrell, murphy, naoupu, miller, stapleton, muldoon; peat, lyons, egan, spence, reilly, griffin, molloy, fitzpatrick (capt). Replacements: o'connor, van staden, o'reilly, cooney, fryday, healy, caughey, coyne.

Judge carlos castro martins reversed the order he had issued in september, which had barred any work on the belo monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the xingu river. He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing. The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists. Judge martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing. He had barred the norte energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals. Legal wrangling. Norte energia appealed against the decision and judge martins ruled on friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work. \"since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,\" he said. Judge martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project \"could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen\". He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by brazil's indian affairs department (funai) and the national environment agency, ibama. Norte energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban. If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the three gorges in china and itaipu, which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay. The government says it is crucial to meeting growing energy needs, but environmentalists and those fighting for indigenous rights have been vociferous in their opposition.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA judge in brazil has lifted a ban on the building of a controversial hydro-electric dam in the amazon region.\n\n",

Between 2012 and 2015, cases of syphilis increased by 76%, from 3,001 to 5,288, while gonorrhoea infections rose by 53%, from 26,880 to 41,193, public health england data reveals. The rise was notable among men who have sex with men. At the same time, rates of genital warts decreased, thanks to a vaccination campaign. Rates of sexually transmitted infections as a group also went down slightly, totalling 434,456. But experts say this could be because fewer people came forward for testing. Chlamydia was the most commonly diagnosed sti, accounting for nearly half of the cases diagnosed in 2015. Young people are routinely offered chlamydia screening, but only 13% of young men and 32% of young women were tested in 2015. The large fall in genital warts - a 7% drop - was seen in young women, and experts say this was probably because of the national human papilloma virus vaccination programme. All girls aged 12 to 13 are offered the jab as part of the nhs childhood vaccination programme. The fpa charity's chief executive, natika halil, said boys should be offered the vaccine too, which is something ministers are considering. Genevieve edwards, of marie stopes uk, said the statistics should \"set alarm bells ringing\" about the availability of sexual health services for young people and men who have sex with men. \"we have to keep a focus on preventing sexual ill health, and providing prompt diagnosis and treatment to those who need it,\" she added. The british association for sexual health and hiv said the continued rise of gonorrhoea was extremely disturbing, given the further spread of drug-resistant infections. Dr gwenda hughes, head of sti surveillance at phe, said: \"we need to do more to raise awareness about stis and how they can be prevented, especially the effectiveness of using condoms. \"we recommend that anyone having sex with a new or casual partner uses condoms and tests regularly for hiv and stis.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nCases of syphilis and gonorrhoea have risen sharply in england over the past five years, figures show.\n\n",

Mrs schlafly was an outspoken opponent of feminism and abortion and helped republicans block the equal rights amendment in the 1970s. She campaigned against communism and is credited with creating the political climate that helped ronald reagan become president. Mrs schlafly publicly endorsed donald trump at a rally in march. Paying tribute to her on monday, the republican presidential candidate described mrs schlafly as \"a patriot, a champion for women and a symbol of strength\". Mrs schlafly's death, in st louis, was announced by the eagle forum, a conservative group she founded in 1972. It described her as an \"iconic  american leader whose love for america was surpassed only by her love of god and her family\". Mrs schlafly was a strong advocate of traditional family values and one of her crowning political victories was helping to stop the equal rights amendment [era] from being added to the us constitution. She once described feminists as \"a bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems\". Donald t critchlow, author of a biography of phyllis schlafly, said that defeating the era helped to usher in a new conservative era in us politics, paving the way for ronald reagan's election in 1980.

The rare tyrannosaurus bataar, 7m long (23ft), was bought by an anonymous bidder for more than $1m (â£630,000) in new york. The sale went ahead despite protests from the mongolian president. Elbegdorj tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the gobi desert, came from mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal. The auctioneers, heritage auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the mongolian leader was put on the sale. Tyrannosaurus bataar is an asian cousin of the meat-eating tyrannosaurus rex. The skeleton in new york is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the bbc's jonathan blake in washington. \"when it comes to dinosaurs, number one, dinosaurs in general are extremely rare. But the rarest of the dinosaurs are the carnivores, the meat eaters - the top of the food chain if you will,\" david herskowitz, director of natural history at heritage auctions, told aptv. \"and, of all the meat eaters that are out there, the most famous are the tyrannosaurids. They are the most desirable, but they are the most elusive. They are the most difficult to find. Even though they are so big, there are not that many of them around.\" Found about seven years ago in the gobi desert, the t. bataar remained in storage in england. The t. bataar was slightly smaller and had longer arms than its cousin, mr herskowitz said. This is the second tyrannosaurid to be sold at auction, says mr herskowitz. The first was a t. rex named sue sold in 1997 for more than $8m. Lawyers for the auction house say the sale did not break any us laws - but it will not be confirmed until it has been approved by a us court.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA fossilised skeleton of a carnivorous dinosaur found in mongolia has been sold at auction.\n\n",

Rather than having links to radical islamism, he was a market trader hoping to make money if the price of shares in the team fell, prosecutors say. The suspect has been charged with attempted murder, triggering explosions and causing serious physical injury. He has been  identified only as sergej w, and was staying in the team's hotel overlooking the scene of the attack. Two people needed medical help after three bombs exploded near the bus. Spanish footballer marc bartra underwent wrist surgery and a police officer was treated for shock. Following the attack on 11 april, borussia dortmund's home champions league match against monaco was rescheduled a day later, which led dortmund fans to open their doors to stranded away supporters. Police initially treated the blast as a terrorist attack. However, the following week, investigators cast \"significant doubt\" on jihadist motivations being behind it. They now say the attack was in fact motivated by financial greed. Sergej w, 28, would have made about €3.9m euros ($4.2m; £3.2m) from his actions, germany's bild newspaper reported. In a statement on friday (in german), the german federal prosecutor's office said he has german and russian nationality. He was arrested on friday near tubingen in rottenburg, south-west germany. The suspect had allegedly bought 15,000 put options on borussia dortmund shares - reportedly priced at €78,000 (£65,000; $83,600) - betting that they would drop sharply after the attack. He would have made large profits if the team's share price collapsed. Experts have likened the alleged plot to a sophisticated form of insider trading - because he tried to use information not widely available to the public to make money quickly. He was staying at the team's l'arrivée hotel in dortmund on the day of the attack and had moved to a room on the top floor, overlooking the street where it took place, prosecutors say. The suspect placed the bet on 11 april using an ip address traced to the hotel, after taking out a loan for the money. Investigators believe three explosive devices packed with metal pins were hidden in a hedge and set off as the bus passed. The bus was damaged about six miles from the westfalenstadion - officially called signal iduna park - in dortmund about 90 minutes before kick-off. Pictures from the scene showed its windows broken and its tyres burst.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA man arrested in connection with a bomb attack on the borussia dortmund team bus was motivated by financial greed, german prosecutors say.\n\n",

It happened at about 16:00 bst on saturday - the blaze spread from one house to neighbouring properties in ballyoran park. It gutted one house and badly damaged two others. No-one was injured, but two dogs died as the fire spread. At this stage police have said they are not treating the fire as suspicious. Fire station commander william weir said five pumps were brought in to bring it under control. \"on arrival the first crews found two houses well alight and the fire spreading either side of them along a row of five terrace houses,\" he said. \"it quickly became apparent that there was an oil tank involved which had allowed its contents to ignite which spread to a second oil tank in the house next door which then further added fuel to quite a large fire. \"the fuel then followed through the gardens of the remaining houses in the street and set fire to a further six garden sheds and some fencing. \"it was quite a large fire and it took crews approximately 35 to 40 minutes of hard fire fighting to stop it spreading to the other properties and to bring it under control and extinguish it.\" Mr weir said an investigation by the fire service and police had concluded that the blaze had started accidentally. \"basically what happened was that some rubbish in the garden which had been burnt earlier in the day and left unattended re-ignited and set fire to a fence and then compromised the oil tank allowing its contents to become involved in the fire and from then the fire grew in intensity,\" he added.\n\nSENTENCE:\nTwo dogs have died in a house fire in west belfast.\n\n",

It's been almost a year since the 26-year-old released her last single. Mccartney is one of the most celebrated artists of the 20th century, selling over 100 millions albums worldwide, as part of the beatles, wings and as a solo artist in his own right. West has previously collaborated with both rihanna and mccartney, though never before as a trio. Four five seconds is a move away from rihanna and west's previous work together on all of the lights (from west's album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy) and run this town, where the pair teamed up with jay z. This time the track is a slower, acoustic guitar-driven number. West played a snippet of four five seconds to industry experts at the iheartmedia music summit on wednesday. It's yet to be confirmed if the song will appear on an album by any of the artists. Though producer ty dolla $ign did tell billboard earlier this month that the song is likely be part of west's upcoming release. It follows west's own collaboration with mccartney at the beginning of the year. When only one was released, a spokesperson for west said that the song would be the first \"publicly available recording from what has become a prolific musical collaboration between these two legendary artists.\" The pair began working together in los angeles last year. At the time a statement noted, it began with \"a simple brainstorming session between the two, with mccartney improvising on the keyboards and kanye vocally sketching and shaping ideas in a stream-of-consciousness riff.\" It's possible four five seconds was also a result of these sessions. 72-year-old mccartney has a long history of collaborations with other artists, singing duets with stevie wonder, michael jackson and george michael.

Wales have not beaten the all blacks in 26 matches since 1953 and the world champions are undefeated at eden park since 1994. Flanker warburton, who starts after a shoulder injury, returns to the ground for the first time since being sent off for a tip-tackle in the 2011 world cup semi-final defeat by france. \"he who dares wins,\" warburton said. Wales are yet to beat new zealand on their own turf and the all blacks have won their last 34 games at the auckland ground. The match will be new zealand's first since beating australia 34-17 in the 2015 world cup final. Steve hansen's side are favourites to win the three-test series, but warburton, 27, says wales must take the game to the home team. \"there are going to be opportunities in the game where it might be on to go out the back or it might be on for somebody to blitz. If it comes off it pays dividends,\" he said. \"you're going to have to take a few risks on saturday, you can't be conservative and expect to win.\" Wales coach warren gatland added: \"when the opportunity arises, we've got to be expansive, we've got to take risks and we've got to play rugby. Often the difference between one side and the other is just a bit of magic.\" Warburton's controversial red card against france in 2011 came as wales' world cup dream ended with a 9-8 defeat. But the british and irish lion says returning to the scene of heartbreak will not play on his psyche. \"there's so much water under the bridge since then. That never even crosses my mind,\" said warburton. \"this is a brand new challenge, to play the all blacks out here.\" Warburton has not played since 30 april and is one of five changes to the team beaten by england last month. The cardiff blues forward says he has benefited from his time on the sidelines. \"it's actually been a little bit of a blessing to freshen me up a bit, to top up the fitness levels,\" he said. \"i've been doing running for a long time now so fitness won't be an issue. \"compared to the other injuries i've had it'll be a much easier transition back into test rugby.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nSam warburton says wales must take risks in saturday's test against new zealand in auckland.\n\n",

The next public consultation in the greater manchester spatial framework (gmsf) scheme was due in september but may not be published until summer 2018. Regional mayor andy burnham promised to revise the plans following protests from affected communities. The revised plans will be announced \"in due course\", the mayor's office said. The gmsf scheme identifies sites for housing developments that may be built over the next 20 years. The area's combined authority, which brings together 10 councils, published a joint plan last october to allocate land for development. Due to the scale of development required to meet expected population growth, it outlined plans to make swathes of protected greenbelt land available for new homes. The authority received more than 25,000 responses to the consultation while community groups protested against the plans. Mr burnham, who was elected as metropolitan mayor in may, promised to \"radically re-write\" the plans, calling them \"unfair and disproportionate\". The bbc understands council leaders are not expecting the next consultation to take place until next year due to the work involved. Matthew collinge from the save our slattocks group, which is opposed to homes being built on greenbelt land between middleton and royton, said the delay was \"disappointing\". He said: \"it stretches out the fear of the unknown and us. It's very easy for people to lose interest and we've been working towards this september deadline. \"we now have to keep people aware of what's happening for longer and that makes it harder for a small community group like ours.\" Matthew good, a spokesman for the house builder's federation said: \"it's important for everybody that we have some certainty on this. \"councils need to invest in infrastructure. They need to know where those developments are going to happen. \"without a plan it's going to be a lot more piecemeal because investors will have to take chances on where they can get development and the councils may not be in control of that.\" A spokesman for mr burnham said the mayor had appointed salford city mayor paul dennett to lead a \"radical\" rewrite of the plans. He added: \"this re-write is currently underway and details on the next round of consultation will be announced in due course.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA consultation on plans to build more than 100,000 homes on greenbelt land in greater manchester has been delayed.\n\n",

The muslim brotherhood's political wing, the islamic action front, called for broader political representation and a more democratic parliament. People at the protest chanted: \"the people want to reform the regime.\" On thursday evening, the king dissolved parliament and called early elections, though he did not specify a date. He has said he wants polls to be held by the end of the year. The iaf said it expected 50,000 people to take part in the protest outside the capital's al-husseini mosque after friday prayers. But the bbc's wyre davies put the turnout at 10,000 people, which he said was the biggest protest seen in jordan for several years. Video footage showed protesters chanting slogans and waving flags. The afp news agency quoted people as shouting: \"we demand constitutional reform before the people revolt. The people want to reform the regime.\" A counter-rally, in support of king abdullah, which organisers had predicted would attract 200,000 supporters, was cancelled late on thursday in order to prevent clashes between the two groups. Earlier, police said they had detained eight people travelling towards the rally and had seized three vehicles containing sticks, knives and guns. Friday's protest in the capital and the dissolution of parliament come amid mounting opposition anger at the electoral law passed in july by the government of the conservative prime minister fayez al-tarawneh. The electoral law increased the number of seats in the house of representatives from 120 to 150 seats and gave the electorate two votes - one for a district representative and one for national level lists that include political parties - replacing the single non-transferable vote. The iaf's leader, hamza mansour, dismissed the legislation as \"just a cosmetic change meant to buy time and insufficient for real reforms\". Opposition parties demanded that 50% of seats be allocated to party lists, but the new electoral law gave them just 27 seats, or 18%. They also complained that the new law would strengthen supporters of the king by allocating three more seats for women from bedouin districts. This, they argued, would continue to marginalise jordanians of palestinian origin - who make up 60% of the population but have little political power - in favour of those descended from jordan's original bedouin inhabitants - whose tribes dominate the government and security forces and are the bedrock of the hashemite monarchy. Traditionally, many of the iaf's supporters have been jordanians of palestinian origin. The opposition also demanded that parliament, rather than the king, should have the right to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. Despite the call for reforms, jordan has so far avoided the unrest and political upheaval that rocked much of the arab world last year. Protests have been relatively small and have not gained the same level of political momentum as those in tunisia, egypt, libya, yemen and syria. Correction 25 january 2013: a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that members of the jordanian security forces were allowed to vote for the first time.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThousands of people have taken part in a protest in the jordanian capital, amman, against a new electoral law.\n\n",

Barbara and colin sellins, from southborough in kent, do not have any immediate family and wanted to make sure their funerals were paid for. They have been told it is unlikely they will get back the â£4,000 they spent. A kent police spokeswoman said they were reviewing the sellins' case and enquiries were ongoing. \"we are also in contact with both the liquidators and official receivers who are also investigating this company,\" added the spokeswoman. Mrs sellins said she found out banham funeral services had gone out of business when she attempted to make contact to change a detail about her ceremony. \"we have worked hard all our lives. We don't owe anybody anything. We don't even have credit cards,\" she said. \"we have been left completely penniless. Who is going to bury us?\" The former management of banham funeral services were contacted by the bbc but declined to comment. According to companies house, the business was liquidated in may 2014. Insolvency firm mha macintyre hudson, which was appointed to wind up the company's affairs, said \"to date there have not been any assets realised and therefore no distribution to creditors\". Graeme mcausland, from the funeral planning authority, said: \"what should happen in a proper arrangement is, if a customer pays money over, that money is put aside in a trust or an insurance policy that is separate from the company that is selling the plan. \"that means it is ring fenced so if the company gets into trouble or goes out of business those assets are still there and therefore the funeral can still happen.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA couple have been left `` completely penniless'' after their funeral company went out of business.\n\n",

There have been ongoing industrial problems in the school for months. The panel consists of leading educationalist prof sir robert salisbury, trade unionist john corey and belfast metropolitan college's principal marie-thã©rã¨se mcgivern. Education minister john o'dowd has said he wants them to complete the investigation by early summer. The secondary school, in the andersonstown area of west belfast, has 1,100 pupils. About a third of its 70-strong teaching staff were absent for a period prior to easter, and, in an unusual move last month, an associate principal was appointed to the school. A group representing some parents also held a number of protests to express their concern about how the disputes were affecting their children. Mr o'dowd said that he wanted the panel to investigate events in the school, and make recommendations \"to ensure the school's future\". \"i consider the panel members to be eminently well qualified and experienced,\" he said. \"my priority continues to be to the pupils at the school and this investigation will give pupils, parents, staff and their representatives, and all those involved with the governance of the school, the opportunity to express their view.\" The investigation will look at staff relationships, the role of senior leadership, governance of the school and the impact of the ongoing disputes on pupils. Mr corey was general secretary of northern ireland public service alliance (nipsa) union from 2003-10 and is currently a member of the northern ireland human rights commission. Prior to her role at belfast metropolitan college, ms mcgivern was director of development at belfast city council. Sir robert, meanwhile, recently chaired the literacy and numeracy task force in northern ireland and is a former professor of education at the university of nottingham. The national association of schoolmasters and union of women teachers (nasuwt), which represents almost half the teachers at de la salle college, welcomed the appointments. It said the move \"should reassure all partners in the de la salle community that minister o'dowd is committed to finding a robust resolution to the recent period of challenge\". However, it said the terms of reference would be \"critical to the success or otherwise of the investigation\". The nasuwt also said it will \"seek assurances from the panel that their work will not cause any further disruption\". Jim clarke, chief executive of the council for catholic maintained schools (ccms), also welcomed the appointment of the panel. \"the background and experience of those who will be carrying out the investigation gives confidence to the process,\" he said. \"ccms will continue with its ongoing work with the other interests through the agreed strategy. It remains focused on the needs and interests of the pupils at the school.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nA panel of experts has been appointed to investigate events at de la salle college.\n\n",

The international anti-corruption summit - the first of its kind - is aimed at exposing, punishing and drive out global corruption. Political leaders, businesses, sporting organisations, and charities will meet at lancaster house on thursday. Mr cameron says corruption is \"the root of so many of the world's problems\". He also described it as \"an enemy of progress\". \"it destroys jobs and holds back economic growth, traps the poorest in desperate poverty, and undermines our security by pushing people towards extremist groups,\" he added. \"the battle against corruption will not be won overnight. It will take time, courage and determination to deliver the reforms that are necessary. But we cannot hope to solve the major global challenges we face without tackling the exploitation, fraud and dishonesty at their heart. \"for too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on. The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs.\" Among the world leaders attending the summit are presidents ashraf ghani of afghanistan, juan manuel santos of colombia and muhammadu buhari of nigeria, and norwegian prime minister erna solberg. Russia is to be represented by deputy foreign minister oleg syromolotov. Panellists are expected to include world bank president jim yong kim and international monetary fund's managing director christine lagarde. Under the prime minister's plans, leaders at the summit would pledge to expose corruption and pursue and punish those who perpetrate, facilitate or are complicit in it. Campaigners have also called for a crackdown on tax havens linked to the united kingdom. The recent panama papers leak showed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to evade tax and avoid sanctions. A downing street spokesman said: \"we are in discussions with the overseas territories and crown dependencies with major financial centres about their attendance, and expect a number to join the summit.\" Robert barrington, of anti-corruption campaigners transparency international, said: \"the prime minister is creating a platform for governments that are serious about fighting corruption to make really significant changes and set the agenda for a generation to come. \"what is key now is that other governments are persuaded to sign up to ambitious targets and that the uk government does not give in to the usual last minute attempts by less committed countries to water down the summit's ambitions\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nDavid cameron has announced plans for a global anti-corruption summit in london.\n\n",

Lon snowden told journalists in moscow he felt \"extreme gratitude that my son is safe and secure and he's free\". He later met his son, local media say. Edward snowden was granted asylum in russia in august after weeks spent in a transit zone at moscow airport when the us revoked his travel documents. The 30-year-old leaked many thousands of us intelligence documents. The information, published in the guardian and washington post newspapers, revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by both us and british intelligence. In the us, edward snowden faces charges of theft of government property, unauthorised communication of national defence information and wilful communication of classified intelligence. Each of the charges carries a maximum 10-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, edward snowden met four former us security officials in russia late on wednesday, it has emerged. The officials - who now campaign against what they describe as the misuse of state secrecy - said they had presented mr snowden with the sam adams associates for integrity in intelligence award. The award is given annually by a group of retired cia officers. The officials told russian media mr snowden had no regrets about leaking the classified files and was convinced he had done the right thing. \"he's remarkably centred,\" ex-fbi agent coleen rowley told state-funded rt television. 'legal options' lon snowden, arriving at moscow's sheremetyevo airport on thursday, was met by his son's russian lawyer, anatoly kucherena. \"i'm here to learn more about my son's situation,\" mr snowden told reporters. \"my hope is to learn more about his circumstances and his health and to discuss legal options.\" \"if the opportunity presents itself, i certainly hope that i have the opportunity to see my son,\" he said in televised remarks. \"i'm not sure that my son will be returning to the us. That's his decision, he's an adult.\" Lon snowden later visited his son, but the place and time of the meeting \"are not being been revealed for security reasons\", said russia's state-run tv channels rossiya 24 and channel one. Lon snowden has in the past praised his son for speaking \"the truth\" and making great sacrifices, and has spoken of his concern that he would not face a fair trial if he returned to the us. Edward snowden accessed many of the documents while working for the defence contractor booz allen hamilton in hawaii, where he had been living with his girlfriend. As the revelations became public, mr snowden fled to hong kong where, with his consent, the guardian revealed his identity in june. To escape us attempts to extradite him, mr snowden moved on to russia where he remained in the transit zone of sheremetyevo airport until russia granted him asylum. Russia's move added to already tense relations with the us. Washington cancelled a bilateral summit in september.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe father of us intelligence leaker edward snowden has arrived in russia to discuss his son's legal options.\n\n",

President juan manuel santos said the authorities do not know how many people are still missing. Heavy rains caused the river liboriana, in the town of salgar, to burst its banks, triggering the landslide. Much of the village of santa margarita, south-west of the provincial capital, medellin, was swept away when the disaster hit early on monday. Rescue teams and residents have got together to dig through rouble in the hope of finding survivors. After visiting the scene of the disaster, mr santos declared a state of emergency and promised to rebuild the houses. \"we cannot bring the dead back, which we regret deeply, and we will support the families (of the victims),\" said mr santos earlier. \"but we have to move on from this tragedy, and look ahead with courage and fortitude.\" \"the priority now is the hospital,\" said the president. Earlier on monday, gas and electricity services in the town were suspended as a precautionary measure. The colombian air force and police have sent helicopters to the area. More than 160 soldiers are working in the emergency effort. Some 100 people have been evacuated from high-risk areas. Local official zulma osorio spoke of a \"tragedy of enormous proportions\". Mud, rocks and tree trunks destroyed many houses in poor neighbourhoods close to the river. Resident jorge quintero described his ordeal when the landslide hit the village: \"when i felt my house shaking we got out, my family and me. When we got out, we were stuck in the middle of the landslide, it was coming from both sides and we were in the middle. \"i said to my wife, let's hold each other and hope that god saves us and i know he gave us his hand because here we are, alive, still frightened, but still alive.\" More rain is expected in the are in the next few days.\n\nSENTENCE:\nRescue teams in colombia are searching for survivors after a landslide killed at least 50 people in the western province of antioquia.\n\n",

The views were expressed following a meeting of the eu negotiation joint ministerial committee in london. Mr davis said the uk government would keep scotland, wales and northern ireland up-to-date about negotiations. However, mr russell said transparency about uk government plans was needed. Mr davis said he wanted to hold a monthly meeting to share analysis as part of a \"two-way information flow\" with each of the three nations. He believed that would allow the devolved administrations to voice their views as the westminster government prepares talks with brussels. Mr davis said: \"today's meeting was an important step in bringing the devolved administrations together with the uk government to discuss how we can work together to get the best deal for the whole of the uk. \"naturally, there are different standpoints around the table, but the meeting was constructive and amicable. We will meet regularly and share our latest thinking as the uk shapes its negotiating strategy. \"we will work positively with the scottish government, the welsh government and the northern ireland executive as we implement the decision of the people of the uk to leave the eu.\" Mr russell said it was \"good\" that the process of involving the scottish government was under way. But he added: \"more than four months after the referendum the uk government has still not made its strategic intentions clear. \"there was a discussion over eu market access but we do not know whether uk ministers want to remain inside the single market or the customs union. This will remain a considerable problem as we continue to promote the interests of scotland. \"the uk government must provide greater clarity and transparency on its intentions.\" He said he made it \"absolutely clear\" that membership of the single market \"is essential for the economic prosperity of scotland\". The uk government hopes the high court judgment on how article 50 will be triggered will be overruled on appeal to the supreme court next month. However, the scottish government will seek to oppose the uk government in the supreme court during the appeal. The intention is for lord advocate james wolffe, scotland's most senior law officer, to apply to be heard in the case.\n\nSENTENCE:\nScottish secretary david russell has called for greater clarity about the uk government's brexit plans.\n\n",

The taoiseach said brexit talks should consider that a clause in the good friday agreement could result in the calling of a referendum. In his remarks to reporters on monday at the annual macgill summer school in glenties, county donegal, mr kenny said the triggering of a border poll required \"clear evidence of a majority of people wishing to leave the uk and join the republic\". He added: \"it may be, in the eyes of some, a fanciful theory but who knows what happens in 10, 20 years time?\" Adams responded by calling for all parties supporting a united ireland \"to discuss how best this can be achieved.\" \"in the context of the north being dragged out of the eu by england, there is now a greater opportunity to achieve this,\" he said.

Those arrested include two builders, police officers and municipality officials. The apartment building came crashing down on thursday. Correspondents say building collapses are common in india, with poor construction practices often blamed. In pictures: mumbai building collapse. There is huge demand for housing, and corruption often leads to cost-cutting and a lack of safety inspections, correspondents say. Police commissioner k p raghuvanshi said the builders were arrested for allegedly paying bribes to police and municipal officials to construct the building in the mumbai suburb of thane without any official sanction. Mr raghuvanshi said on sunday that the nine would be formally charged with culpable homicide and causing death by negligence, once the investigation into the accident had been completed. If convicted, they face sentences of up to life in prison. Most of the victims of the thane collapse were poor daily wage earners working at the site, and their families. The dead included 30 children and 18 women. Building work had continued at the block even though four floors were already occupied. One police official told the bbc that the collapse appeared to have been caused by the use of substandard building material. Witnesses said the construction of the building started just six weeks ago, since when seven floors had been built. The eighth floor was under construction. In a similar collapse in 2010, 69 people were killed in delhi.\n\nSENTENCE:\nPolice in india have arrested nine people in connection with the collapse of a building in the western city of mumbai that killed 59 people.\n\n",

The international federation for human rights (fidh) said some people were killed simply because they did not have identity documents. A malian army officer was quoted as denying the allegations. Meanwhile, the un says 7,100 civilians have fled to neighbouring states since 10 january to escape fighting. Reports suggesting that the mainly black african malian army, drawn largely from the south, has targeted arabs and ethnic tuaregs from the north expose a racial aspect to the war here which has been hidden by the emphasis on western troops fighting a war against islamist insurgents, the bbc's mark doyle in mali says. France intervened militarily on 11 january to halt a militant advance. It said al-qaeda linked islamists - some of whom were foreigners - threatened to turn mali into a \"terrorist state\". It has bombed suspected rebel positions and deployed about 2,000 troops to help the weak malian army recapture territory. Fidh said there needed to be an independent investigation into alleged abuses committed by malian soldiers and those responsible should be punished. In the garrison town of sevare, at least seven people were executed at a military camp, near a bus station and a hospital, it said. There was \"credible information\" pointing to 20 other executions in sevare, with bodies \"buried hastily, notably in wells\", fidh said. Summary killings also took place in the towns of mopti and niono, the group added. \"other allegations of summary executions continue to come from all areas of the west and centre of the country,\" it said. It added that some of the victims were accused of possessing weapons, and of being \"infiltrators\" and \"accomplices\" of the militants. Others were killed because they did not have identity documents or simply because of their ethnicity, fidh said. Dozens of ethnic tuaregs in mali's capital, bamako, have also had their homes raided by troops, the group added. Voices from diabaly after rebel battle. The malian army's capt modibo traore said the allegations were \"completely false\" but declined to comment further, ap news agency reports. United nations refugee agency (unhcr) regional coordinator valentin tapsoba said 7,100 people had fled to neighbouring countries in the last two weeks to escape fighting. Most of them - some 4,000 - had fled to mauritania, mali's western neighbour, mr tapsoba told the bbc's focus on africa programme. He said a further 3,100 people had crossed into burkina faso and chad, to the east of mali. Nearly 10,000 have also also moved into camps inside mali since 10 january, he said. The latest conflict erupted after the militants advanced southwards, attacking the central towns of konna, diabaly and douentza.

Conservative mp for dover and deal charlie elphicke said: \"it is a real concern for the... people in dover who have worked for seafrance and also their families. \"this is a difficult day and i think the heart of the whole community goes out to them. \"obviously it's a real blow, [if] seafrance isn't operating that means there's less ferry traffic.\" There were tears from seafrance workers who gathered outside the court in paris to hear the decision on the firm's future. Many were protesting over the handling of seafrance's fate, with one banner questioning why french president, nikolas sarkozy had not intervened to save the company. Flares were lit in protest at the company's liquidation. Eurotunnel has not ruled out a future bid for the cross-channel ferry firm, which employs nearly 1,000 people. Mr elphicke said of eurotunnel's proposals: \"many people will want to know that they weren't simply going to buy them [seafrance's ferries] in order to scrap them. \"we need to make sure they give a clear plan as to why they are interested in the ferry business and not simply going to take out capacity. \"everyone is working as hard as they can to ensure that their jobs will be safeguarded and working as hard as they can to ensure that those ships will be back on route with a new buyer and a new purchaser.\" A spokesman said eurotunnel would \"now be working to see what the fair value of the assets\" were before making any decision. The french firm went into receivership in 2010 and its company's ferries carried more than 3.5 million passengers a year on the dover to calais route. A spokeswoman from seafrance said: \"seafrance is sad to announce that the tribunal de commerce in paris has made the decision to liquidate the company. \"despite the best efforts of all parties, the court came to the difficult conclusion that none of the options available to it were financially viable. \"provision has been made to ensure that all customers with pre-existing bookings will receive refunds.\" She urged customers to contact seafrance for details.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA court in france has ordered the liquidation of cross-channel ferry firm seafrance, with the loss of 1,000 jobs.\n\n",

The witness also said her family had been forced to move to spain to escape her daughter's alleged abusers. Sheffield crown court also heard how police lost tapes of an interview with defendant sageer hussain in 2003. Eight men, including mr hussain, deny sexually abusing three girls between 1999 and 2003. The mother of one of the alleged victims said in a statement: \"her character changed from a lovely girl to an animal. She became horrible.\" She said at one stage she discovered a mobile phone in her daughter's bedroom and rang a number stored under the name'waleed'. She said a man picked up the phone and said \"i ain't done owt, i ain't touched her. It isn't me\". When she asked her daughter about the phone she said she burst into tears and said \"they're raping me, they're raping me\". She told the court after her daughter went to the police in 2003 her family were repeatedly threatened. \"we were so distraught that we sold the business and the home and moved to spain,\" she said. Det con andy stephanek, of south yorkshire police, told the court the force had lost the tape of an interview with mr hussain when he was first questioned about the allegations. He said it appeared that \"due to the passage of time they've been destroyed\".

First minister nicola sturgeon said the transition training fund should help keep expertise in the energy sector, or in related roles in manufacturing. She said job losses were \"distressing\". The fund will offer grants for individuals to acquire specialised skills or further training. Ms sturgeon was meeting industry leaders and attending an energy jobs task force in aberdeen. She said: \"it is absolutely crucial that we take every possible action to retain the expertise that the industry has built up over decades so that it remains flexible enough to capitalise on exploration investment and future oil price rises.\" Also announced was £12.5m of scottish enterprise funding aimed at helping oil and gas firms sustain growth and compete internationally by developing new innovative technologies. The announcements - and plans for a £20m aberdeen international airport revamp - came just days after a £504m package was announced earlier by the uk and scottish governments to improve infrastructure in aberdeen and aberdeenshire, and to attract new jobs. North east scotland labour msp lewis macdonald said: \"the scottish government's offer of extra money to train those made redundant by the oil and gas industry is a step in the right direction but a year later than it should have been. \"this is the kind of initiative which should have been put in place when the north sea saw the first signs of a crisis, not after an estimated 65,000 people have already lost their jobs.\" North east scotland lib dem msp alison mcinnes said: \"this is welcome support for the tens of thousands of people who have lost their jobs because of the downturn in the oil and gas industry. \"they are incredibly skilled staff whose experience cannot be wasted and who need to know the opportunities and help they need to retrain is available. \"what we now need to know is how exactly this fund will be distributed, who can apply and clear details as they come in of how many people are actually benefiting.\" The cost of a barrel of brent crude oil has decreased from more than $100 in january 2014 to less than $30 in january of this year.

Domenico masciopinto, 35, was sentenced to 14 years in 2012 for drug-dealing. From prison he told his now estranged wife giulia masciopinto, 37, to unearth cash buried in their bedford garden. She has been jailed for nine months. Her mother caterina de filippo, 58, and sister palma de filippo, 28, were given 12-month sentences for helping her. Domenico masciopinto was sentenced to 22 months, after admitting concealing criminal property, to run consecutively to his 14-year term. His wife also pleaded guilty to the charge, but the de filippos, who she enlisted but who denied the accusations, were found guilty last month. Judge kristina montgomery qc, sitting at amersham law courts for aylesbury crown court, said the masciopintos would have been jailed for longer if they had not admitted the crime. Cash was found by police stuffed around the bedford homes of giulia masciopinto, in redhall close, and her mother's in harrowden road, in march 2013. Officers were alerted by masciopinto's recorded prison calls to his wife, as he feared the buried cash would perish as it was not in watertight containers. A holdall containing £237,000 was discovered, while thousands of pounds were also found in a handbag, plastic bag and foil-wrapped bundles. Other money had been paid into bank accounts. Palma de filippo, of high st, acton, west london, helped by hiding some of the cash in her car boot and laundering it. Det insp pushpa guild, of bedfordshire police, called it a \"sophisticated attempt\" to hide criminal proceeds. Police said some seized cash would go towards paying a £121,736 confiscation order, made after masciopinto was jailed three years ago. However, some notes were unusable as they had turned mouldy due to the way they were stashed.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA woman has been jailed for helping her husband hide more than £ 200,000 in a garden.\n\n",

When the red lion in northmoor was put up for sale last year, locals formed the northmoor lion ltd, secured a loan and bought the pub in november 2013. Since then, 70 people have bought company shares, raising about £300,000. Parish council chairman graham shelton said the community was \"very excited\" after six-months of hard work. \"northmoor has proved that if there is an energetic group of people that want to get things done, you can get things done,\" he added. \"when the pub came on the market, we feared we'd lose it. Alongside the church and village hall, it's greatly valued by local people and is at the heart of our community.\" Previous owners greene king put the pub up for sale at the beginning of the year after failing to find new tenants. Mr shelton said villagers explored \"making it a community asset\" but decided to buy it after securing a loan from \"a private individual\". The pub will now be run as a free house and mr shelton said the company had been \"overwhelmed\" with the response to an advertisement for tenants. It will be run by first-time landlords ian neale and lisa lyne, who have 30 years' industry experience between them. Mr shelton added that the couple \"ticked all the boxes\" for the local community, including \"experience, capability, friendliness and empathy\".

The board is debating whether to suspend the entire russian team from the games following a doping scandal. \"i apologise unreservedly for any offence i have caused. I am truly sorry,\" franco kasper said. The international ski federation president was discussing a proposed blanket ban on russian athletes when he made the holocaust comment, referring to the world war ii genocide that saw six million jews killed by adolf hitler's nazi germany. He reportedly said: \"i'm just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like mr hitler did - all jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do.\" When challenged by reporters at the time, franco kasper responded: \"why not? Of course it's more extreme. But just the fact that the place you come from makes you guilty, i'm not ok for this, really not.\" Russia did not receive a blanket ban from the ioc from the 2016 olympics in rio, opting to leave the decision to individual sports' governing bodies.

Ronan toolis led the excavation works at trusty's hill fort at gatehouse of fleet. It unearthed evidence that it might have been the royal seat of the sixth century kingdom of rheged. Mr toolis said it was \"pre-eminent among the kingdoms of the north\" at that time. The location of rheged had previously been thought by many historians to be in cumbria. However, dr christopher bowles, co-director of the excavation work in dumfries and galloway, said that may not have been the case. \"the new archaeological evidence from trusty's hill enhances our perception of power, politics, economy and culture at a time when the foundations for the kingdoms of scotland, england and wales were being laid,\" he said. \"the 2012 excavations show that trusty's hill was likely the royal seat of rheged, a kingdom that had galloway as its heartland. \"this was a place of religious, cultural and political innovation whose contribution to culture in scotland has perhaps not been given due recognition.\" Dr bowles said the influence of the kingdom had \"rippled through the history and literature of scotland and beyond\". Mr toolis added that they had not been looking for rheged when they started the excavations. \"what drew us to trusty's hill were pictish symbols carved on to bedrock here, which are unique in this region and far to the south of where pictish carvings are normally found,\" said mr toolis. \"the galloway picts project was launched in 2012 to recover evidence for the archaeological context of these carvings. \"but far from validating the existence of galloway picts, the archaeological context revealed by our excavation instead indicates the carvings relate to a royal stronghold and place of inauguration for the local britons of galloway around ad 600. \"the new archaeological evidence suggests that galloway may have been the heart of the lost dark age kingdom of rheged, a kingdom that was in the late sixth century pre-eminent amongst the kingdoms of the north.\" The two men have produced a new book which details their findings.

Jon schueler, who died in new york in 1992 at the age of 75, created many of his pieces from a studio in mallaig in the highlands. He was inspired by views of the sound of sleat and also of skye, which lies across the stretch of sea. An arts symposium and exhibition at the college runs from friday to sunday. Called an linne: echoes, reflections and transfigurations, the events mark the centenary of the artist's birth in milwaukee, wisconsin, in 1916. The painter, who served as a navigator on us bombers flown out of england during world war two, moved to mallaig in 1957 and he continued to visit and work in the village in the north-west highlands throughout his career. Many of his pieces were influenced by the changing weather on the west coast and the effect the conditions had on the sea. Magda salvesen, curator of the jon schueler estate, said: \"the sound of sleat became to schueler a place of experience, memory and mood. \"the specificity of this body of water fed schueler's paintings - their imagery enlarged through layers of memory. \"how appropriate and challenging that the symposium celebrating the artist's centenary should be held on skye, an island seen through changing weather from his studio in mallaig.\" The celebration at smo - scotland's national centre for gaelic language and culture, and which offers a jon schueler residency scholarship - includes talks on schueler's life and work and an exhibition of selected pieces from his time in mallaig. Donnie munro, director of development, fundraising and the arts at smo, described the artist as having a \"profoundly deep experiential affinity with the sound of sleat\". He said this connection led schueler to create some of his most celebrated works.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA celebration to mark the centenary of the birth of one of scotland's best-known artists is being held at skye college.\n\n",

They say the arrests happened when protesters refused to leave land owned by the pipeline company. A spokesman said the latest arrests brought the number detained since august to almost 700. They came after the us army was ordered to allow the construction of the final section of the dakota access pipeline. Native americans and their supporters have protested against the project for months, and have vowed to fight on. The standing rock sioux tribe say the final section - under lake oahe, a reservoir on the missouri river - would contaminate drinking water on their land and damage sacred burial sites. Morton county sheriff's office spokesman rob keller said the latest arrests were made after demonstrators moved from their existing camp on flood-prone ground to land owned by the pipeline company, energy transfer partners. He said no injuries had been reported during the operation. Protest leaders could not be reached for comment. The $3.7bn (â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from north dakota to a terminal in illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries. The us army corps of engineers, which has approval authority, decided last year to explore other routes for the pipeline amid huge protests by the standing rock sioux tribe. But earlier this week, acting secretary of the army robert speer ordered the corps to allow the work to go ahead.

The warning comes as the scottish curry industry will celebrate its annual awards ceremony in glasgow on monday. The rules prevent non-eu chefs being employed if a restaurant offers a take-away service. The uk government said this was designed to drive innovative cuisine. But industry sources say it has led to restaurants closing because they cannot recruit skilled chefs. The rules, laid down by the migration advisory committee (mac) and the home office, are part of the tier 2 visa scheme, which allows workers of sufficient skill levels to be employed on the shortage occupation list. They must be paid at least â£29,570 a year, and to meet the criteria the job must also not be in a fast food or \"standard fare\" outlet, or an establishment which provides a take-away service. But ajmal mushtaq, who runs a restaurant in hamilton providing up to 3,000 meals a week, said that was \"total insanity\". Holding two portions of a curry - one on a plate, the other in a take-away carton - he said: \"here is a chicken tikka chasni, one of our top selling dishes. \"what the government are saying is: if i put that same dish into a container, i'm not allowed to bring expert chefs over from india. \"the quality is the exact same.\" Mr mushtaq said the restriction meant that plans to expand his restaurant have been put on hold. He currently employs three indian-born chefs who have been in scotland long enough to qualify for permanent resident status, but wants to increase his staffing. \"as a result of bringing over three chefs a few years ago, i have been able to create 52 jobs in this business,\" he said. \"we are at the point of expanding our business. If i were to bring over another two chefs, i would be able to increase the number of employees up to 95 in this one establishment alone.\" The industry has been putting pressure on the government to review its rules, particularly in the wake of the brexit vote, which it sees as offering an opportunity to workers outwith the eu. International development secretary priti patel, who campaigned for a leave vote said during the campaign, said it was a \"travesty\" that curry houses were subjected to a \"second class uk immigration system\" in comparison to eu chefs. With a growth in online apps such as hungry house and just eat promoting home delivery of food, hans ram, chief executive of the catering recruitment agency goldstar chefs, said the government approach to the indian restaurant sector was wrong. \"they have totally misunderstood and misconceived the industry as being a low-paid, low-skilled jobs base. Which it is not,\" he said. \"the biggest consequence to this is actually the skills erosion - erosion of authenticity. \"it is affecting the product that the public are being served.\" He also pointed out that the indian restaurant sector in the uk is worth an estimated â£4bn a year.\n\nSENTENCE:\nRestrictions on the number of non-eu chefs being allowed to work in scottish curry houses have been described as `` total insanity''.\n\n",

Judge thomas lipps rejected arguments by defence lawyers that witnesses could face intimidation or harassment outside the courthouse in steubenville. The case has attracted attention due to social media and the high profile of the football team in the small town. Judge lipps also ruled the non-jury trial would be open to the public. He did so over the objections of the family of the 16-year-old girl who was allegedly attacked. She wanted to protect her identity and keep evidence that might eventually be ruled inadmissible from becoming public. Trenton mays and ma'lik richmond, both 16, deny the charges they face next month at a juvenile court. Three other students who witnessed the alleged attack but were not charged are expected to testify at next month's trial. Those witnesses include two who took a video and photograph, then deleted the images. The ohio attorney general's office told lawyers for those students last autumn that if the images had been found, they would have been charged. Prosecutors say the girl, who went to a school across the river from the city in west virginia, was attacked after an alcohol-fuelled party last august. The case was thrust into the national spotlight after attention by bloggers and the hacker activist group anonymous. Some claimed that the community had sought to cover up the alleged crime in order protect the two accused. The trial is set for 13 march.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA judge in the us state of ohio has ruled the trial of two ohio state university students accused of raping a girl will go ahead as planned.\n\n",

City council leader lib dem simon cook will tell a conference an arena on the site of the old diesel depot site is a crucial part of the zone. He stressed although it was early days potential operators believe its size would attract many good quality shows. Mr cook said there was a risk a larger version would be built in cardiff if the bristol arena did not go ahead. \"we've fallen behind cardiff too often in the past. It is really time to grab the opportunity and go for it. \"there is a very big interest in an arena for bristol... we're absolutely determined to deliver it,\" he added. It is believed the arena would cost up to â£80m to build, some of which will come from the government's city deal fund. Several plans for an entertainment arena have been put forward since 2003 but the idea was dropped in 2007 when costs rose to â£86m. Then in 2009, plans for a 15,000-seater music and sport venue were proposed with a second site at ashton vale close to where bristol city football club wants to build a new stadium. The city's biggest music venue is the famous colston hall, which can hold about 2,000 people.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA 10,000-seater entertainment arena could be built in bristol as part of the city's regeneration zone.\n\n",

Age scotland says official figures suggest that each year about 8,640 people in scotland wait longer than six weeks for a council care assessment. The average \"worst case\" is between two weeks and five months, with the longest delay of 18 months recorded in 2014/15. Cosla, the umbrella body for local councils, declined to comment. Age scotland's research, compiled using freedom of information requests, found significant variations across councils in the time taken to carry out assessments. Under national guidelines, people should wait no longer than six weeks for care services to be provided after an assessment has taken place. Age scotland found that about 10% of people were not provided with services within the six-week limit over the past three years. The charity said its research suggested that about 3,000 elderly people each year wait longer than six weeks for services to be put in place. Most councils do not record the reasons why delays occur, but many cited instances where delays were caused by the person being admitted to hospital or waiting for a place in their chosen care home. Staff shortages, financial constraints and delays in adapting homes were also cited. Age scotland received freedom of information responses from 25 out of 32 councils. Chief executive keith robson said: \"these are deeply concerning figures showing thousands of older people facing delays in the care provision they need being put in place. \"it also means payments for free personal care they are entitled to are not being received. \"this confirms the experiences of a number of older people and their families who have been in touch with age scotland's helpline to tell us their experiences of delays in the system. \"as we look to local authority elections next month, age scotland has contacted council candidates across scotland to ask them to ensure providing high-quality health and social care services is made an urgent priority by new administrations.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nTens of thousands of elderly people are being left waiting for care services they need, according to a charity.\n\n",

Chay roberts-jones was working at blundells school at tiverton, devon, when he assaulted the girl under the guise of giving her a sports massage. Roberts-jones, 29, was cleared of sexually assaulting two other girls at a summer ball and a camping trip by a jury in february at exeter crown court. He was a physics teacher at the â£31,000 a year school but now lives in france. The court heard details of the conviction are to be supplied to the french authorities to ensure roberts-jones, previously of preston street, exeter, is not able to work with children again. In may 2014, he offered to give his victim a massage after she suffered cramp but went on to lift her top and try to pull down her trousers. Recorder mr philip mott, qc said there was a \"higher culpability because of the abuse of trust\". He said: \"this was not just flirting and an error of judgment but a more determined effort to pursue your desire and overcome her resistance.\" The judge said roberts-jones, who now teaches adults in france, had experienced \"substantial punishment in terms of career, self image and place in society\" and suspended his sentence for two years. He ordered roberts-jones to pay â£2,500 costs and sign on the sex offenders register. Emily cook, for the defence, said there was an \"element of infatuation\" with the victim which \"got out of hand\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nA teacher who sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl at a school has been given a suspended sentence.\n\n",

Hamilton struggled to fourth behind the ferraris of title leader sebastian vettel and kimi raikkonen while team-mate valtteri bottas took a maiden win. Hamilton said: \"big congratulations to valtteri. Fantastic job and he deserves the win. He has been fast all weekend. \"for me, just a very, very odd weekend. I am just hopeful in the next races i will be able to pick up the pace.\" Bottas' win ensured the damage to hamilton in the championship was limited as much as possible - vettel now leads by 13 points but it would have been 20 had the german won the race. \"it's great we are ahead of the ferraris,\" the briton said. \"it has stopped sebastian pulling away too far.\" Hamilton was more than half a second slower than bottas in qualifying and as the finn made a blistering start from third and took the lead at the first corner, hamilton did not make ground from fourth on the grid. The 32-year-old suffered overheating problems as he chased raikkonen in the first stint of the race and dropped back over the pit-stop period to finish 25 seconds behind the finn and 36 behind bottas. \"i don't remember the last time we had that [overheating],\" hamilton said. \"it meant i was out of the race from the get-go. \"i think i had the pace to fight with kimi but the car was just overheating the whole the time. I'm sure we will go back to the drawing board and figure it out.\" Bottas joined mercedes over the winter following the retirement of world champion nico rosberg. Bottas said his first win felt \"surreal\", but added: \"it's a good feeling and i am happy.\" He added: \"i always knew i could get good results if everything goes right and i always trust in my ability. But it's nice to get confirmation that the results are possible. \"it took quite a while, more than 80 races for me, but it's definitely worth the wait. This strange opportunity came to me in the winter to join the team and they made it possible, so i want to thank them.\" Bottas moves into third place in the championship, 23 points behind vettel and 10 behind hamilton. He said: \"[winning the title] has always been the only goal for me in my career but i have not had the chance to prove it. Now i have the chance to prove i can win races and titles.

The \"shocking\" incident happened at about 11.55 as the 57-year-old security guard approached the tesco store in annick street in shettleston. The robber took the money box before making off in a small white car, later found burnt out nearby. Police have appealed for anyone with information to contact them. Officers said the white hyundai i10 sped away from the scene of the robbery towards springboig road. It is believed there was a second man driving the vehicle, although police have yet to provide a description. Det insp clark hill said: \"due to the fact that it was believed that a firearm was present, our armed response units also attended but have since stood down. \"the suspect knew very well when the van would be there. It certainly wasn't done on the spur of the moment. \"with that in mind, it's possible that the car had been in the area either immediately prior to the robbery or indeed the past few days checking the area out.\" No-one was seriously injured in the incident but a security guard, aged 37, from tesco, who came to the victim's aid suffered a minor injury to his knee after being struck by the car, police said. He was treated at the scene by paramedics and did not need to go to hospital. Mr hill added: \"although thankfully, no-one involved in this incident was seriously injured, this was a terrifying ordeal for the men involved. Also, for it to take place outside a busy supermarket in the middle of the afternoon is just shocking.\" Officers have been at the scene carrying out inquiries and are checking cctv both at the supermarket and in the street.

The oscar-winning john ford film has been conserved in the us national film registry for its \"cultural, historical, or aesthetic\" significance. But brawling and boozing feature prominently in the 1952 film, which was shot in county mayo and county galway. An official warned \"the theme is not likely to be well received here\". Although counsellor joseph brennan said the film's colour was \"beautiful\" and its scenery \"delightful\", he raised fears it would provoke protests from irish-americans. His concerns were addressed to the irish government's department of external affairs in a letter dated 17 april 1952, the irish times reports. He asked for a swift reply as he wanted to gauge the reaction to the film in ireland, but no response was received until june. Another missive from the embassy official in july added: \"if it were to be taken completely at its face value it would be accepted as a rollicking farce and no harm done. \"but i fear it will be regarded by the irish-american element here as purporting to portray actual life in ireland. \"we may then have protests.\" Mr brennan's concerns are outlined in the latest volume of documents on irish foreign policy 1951-1957 which are due to be published later this week. The quiet man, which starred john wayne as boxer sean thornton and maureen o'hara as mary kate danaher, won oscars for best director and best cinematography. When it was added to the film registry in 2013, o'hara described it as \"the first great movie about ireland\" and said it had endured as it was \"a simple and timeless story about people in love\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe republic of ireland's embassy in the united states raised concerns about the release of the quiet man because of its depiction of irish life.\n\n",

The corporation had charged users subscription fees to watch programmes via the app in western europe, australia and canada. However, it never came to the us. Reports suggest american pay-tv operators had threatened to drop the bbc america channel if the app had launched locally because they believed it would cost them viewers. Both bbc america and the international edition of iplayer screen some of the corporation's best known programmes, including doctor who, top gear, sherlock and david attenborough's natural history documentaries. Press releases had always described the online facility as a \"pilot\" meant to provide \"consumer insights\". Bbc worldwide - the broadcaster's commercial arm -  first announced it intended to pull support for the global iplayer app in october 2013, saying it would instead focus on making material available via the bbc.com website. The corporation repeated the point in its annual review last july, but until now had not provided an exact shut-off date. \"as announced in july 2014, the service will be closing this year as planned,\" said a spokeswoman. \"the service will close on 26 june.\" She declined to provide usage statistics. The global iplayer app was first made available as an ios app in july 2011 but was never extended beyond apple's platform. European users were charged a €5.99 (£4.30) monthly fee, while canadians and australians were offered a slightly cheaper rate of 6.99 canadian dollars (£3.70) and 7.49 australian dollars (£3.80). The content provided was distinct from that offered via the uk version, including older shows from the corporation's library in addition to recently broadcast programmes. In total, more than 2,000 hours of shows were on offer on the global edition of iplayer, including gavin and stacey, fawlty towers, planet earth and \"classic\" episodes of doctor who. Users have been notified of the switch-off, and auto-renewing subscriptions are being cancelled. \"we would like to thank all of our subscribers for using the service. We are now developing plans to launch new digital services across multiple devices,\" reads a statement on bbc worldwide's site.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe bbc has confirmed it will shut down its global edition of the iplayer app on 26 june.\n\n",

The claim comes after extra fundraising powers for councils were outlined in last week's government spending review. But the lga said councils would still face a combined shortfall of £6.8bn by the end of the parliament. The government said council tax was expected to be lower in real terms in 2020 than a decade earlier. In the spending review, chancellor george osborne said local authorities responsible for adult social care would be allowed to increase council tax by 2% above existing limits. By adding in the maximum new levies allowable without a referendum, the lga estimated that band d bills could cost an average of just under £200 more over the next five years. It said this would not be enough, particularly as budgets continued to face new pressures such as those caused by an aging population. Any shortfall might have to be made up by further increases to costs such as car parking charges, it added. One senior councillor said councils were now also facing \"a reckless gamble\" of having to use cash reserves to fund services. A department for communities and local government spokesman said: \"in reality councils will have almost £200bn to spend on local services over the lifetime of this parliament, a cash terms increase and a reduction of just 1.7% in real terms each year. \"the spending review offers a £3.5bn package for adult social care to ensure councils can support their older and most vulnerable residents, while at the same time council tax is expected to be less in 2019-20 in real terms than it was in 2010-11. \"with councils accounting for a quarter of all public spending it's right they continue to play their part in paying off the deficit.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nCouncil tax bills could rise by an average of £ 200 over the next five years, the local government association has warned.\n\n",

Nye frankie newman, 17, from aldershot in hampshire, died in the french capital on new year's day. Speaking at the memorial in guildford, his mother debs malone told the crowd of teenagers to carry his spirit \"forever\". A minute's silence was held at the event, organised by the brewman parkour group mr newman co-founded. His friends took part in a \"remembrance jam\" afterwards. Ms malone, 49, said: \"can i ask you all, please carry nye's spirit with you forever and always, and smile. \"i want you all to put your hand on your heart now and we are going to get down for my boy. \"stay safe, stay brave, stay strong yeah? And be happy.\" Alex grubb, 18, who helped to organise the event, described the teenager as kind, caring and \"very eccentric\". He said: \"he had his own style, he wasn't like anyone else. He was a bit out there, very opinionated but very loving at the same time.\" Organisers estimated about 200 people attended the memorial. Before the event, guildford council and surrey police had warned businesses to take \"reasonable measures to prevent rooftop access\". But organiser luke stones, 16, said: \"we have had made it clear people should not go on rooftops. \"if they go on rooftops, it's not parkour, that's another sport. Today, we are sticking to ground level.\" He said rooftop running was more usually referred to as urbex, climbing or roof-topping. Mr stones said people had travelled from across europe and hong kong, where mr newman visited in the summer. He said organisers could not comment on mr newman's death, but confirmed he \"was not participating in parkour\" at the time of the accident. Guildford council said it provided portsmouth road car park as a meeting place for the memorial, but not as a place for free-running. A statement said: \"by providing an area for the memorial event, the council does not condone or encourage parkour or free-running in our car parks, properties or anywhere else in the town or borough, whether it is at a low level or on rooftops.\" Mr stones defended the activity and said: \"it is another form of exercise. \"it is a way to express your emotions through movement. \"when you're doing parkour you're at one with yourself, it's almost like a meditation.\" The uk this year became the first country to officially recognise parkour as a sport.\n\nSENTENCE:\nHundreds of people have attended a memorial for a teenager who died while performing parkour in paris.\n\n",

Their 196-run first-innings lead came mainly thanks to tom kohler-cadmore (102) and ed barnard (59). Further contributions down the order allowed the visitors to reach 403 all out for five batting bonus points. Glamorgan started well with jacques rudolph and nick selman putting on 74 for the first wicket, but they ended 141-3 at the close, 55 runs behind. Worcestershire claimed three wickets for 34 runs to reduce glamorgan to 108-3, but colin ingram (41 not out) and aneurin donald saw out the rest of the day. Glamorgan bowler michael hogan told bbc wales sport: \"it seemed to go through different stages at different times. It was a little trickier at times and then got easier as ball got softer. The boys toiled hard but it could have been a bit better. \"it was good to see lukas carey doing well. He has done a lot of work in pre-season and he has worked really hard on his fitness and his technique, so it is good to see him being given a chance and taking it with both hands. \"i'm fitter after a winter off, probably lacked a bit of bowling conditioning. I've had a few weeks off with injury so probably i got bit tired towards the end. \"we thought with the sun out after about 35 or 40 overs it got a bit easier, but they have got a good attack so we will have to absorb a bit of pressure.

Convicted murderer sweat, 35, was shot twice and captured less than two miles (3km) from the canadian border. His prison-break partner richard matt, 49, was killed by police on friday. The two murderers escaped three weeks ago from the maximum security clinton correctional facility in dannemora through the sewer system after using power tools to break out of their cell. The spectacular escape set off a massive manhunt. Sweat was shot and seized in the town of constable on sunday, new york state governor andrew cuomo told a news conference. He said sweat was shot twice in the torso and was now in hospital in stable condition. The convict was spotted by a police officer on patrol and shot when he tried to run away. \"the nightmare is finally over,\" the governor said. Meanwhile, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives wrote on its twitter page: \"$davidsweat of the $prisonbreakny captured. Sleep peacefully new york.\" The buffalo news website earlier quoted a source who said that the convict's wound were \"life-threatening\" and he was bleeding badly. Matt was shot dead near the town of malone. The pair had been making their way through rugged forests in upstate new york, stealing food and guns from woodland cabins along the way. Us officials have charged prison worker joyce mitchell with aiding the two inmates in their escape. Prosecutors allege that she gave the men power tools that allowed them to saw through a steel cell wall before bashing a hole through a brick wall and crawling through. Ms mitchell denies the charges. Clinton correction officer gene palmer is also accused of aiding the convicts. Officials allege that he gave sweat and matt the frozen hamburger meat ms mitchell had used to hide hacksaw blades and a screwdriver. Mr palmer's attorney said his client had no knowledge that the meat contained the escape tools. Matt was serving a prison sentence of 25 years to life for the killing and dismembering of his former boss. Sweat was serving a life sentence for murdering a sheriff's deputy.

Mr gove said he regretted standing for the tory leadership, saying he made \"mistakes\" in the way he withdrew his support from boris johnson. He now had to take the consequences of his decision, including the fact that an act of treachery has become widely known as \"doing a gove\", he said. The 49-year-old former justice secretary made the comments during an interview with fern britton, to be broadcast on bbc one on sunday. He appeared to suggest he had not given up on a return to front-line politics, saying he hoped to \"make a contribution\" in the future. Mr gove said his decision to back leave in the eu referendum had placed a \"significant strain\" on his relationship with his long-term friend david cameron. He and his wife, daily mail journalist sarah vine, had been close friends with mr cameron and his wife samantha - but the two couples have not had a \"proper conversation\" since the 23 june poll, he said. Mr cameron quit as prime minister after he lost the eu referendum, sparking a leadership campaign which saw mr gove back boris johnson. He then changed his mind and decided to run himself, publicly questioning mr johnson's ability to do the job. Mr gove would not reveal what mr johnson said to him when they spoke after he withdrew his support, but he conceded that \"the way in which i declared my stand for the leadership, i shouldn't have done it that way\". \"as i look back on that time, i think that there were mistakes that i made... \"i also think that my initial instinct that i was not the best person to put themselves forward as a potential prime minister, well most of my colleagues agreed.\" After mrs may entered downing street, mr johnson entered the cabinet as foreign secretary, while mr gove remains on the conservative backbenches. \"when theresa may became prime minister she said that she no longer had a place for me in the cabinet and, to be honest, if i'd been in her shoes i would have sacked me too,\" said mr gove. \"so i entirely accept that sacking me at the time was the right thing to do. \"i had six years when i was a government minister. I had a chance to make a difference - i hope that i did.\" But he conceded that \"nothing is forever in politics\". \"i have to accept that the way in which i spent the final week or so of my ministerial life involved my making mistakes and having made mistakes you have to take the consequences.\" Mr gove said he is now focusing on his work on the commons committee on exiting the eu and wanted to campaign for children at risk of abuse or neglect.

In may, mr joyce vowed to press charges against a man who struck him with a pie over his support for same-sex marriage, which is not legal in australia. Mr joyce has also faced criticism from some politicians who say he should not take a political stance on behalf of the airline. However, he said his company \"would be active out there\" in campaigning. \"i believe we have to get behind it and make sure that we have a'yes' vote and certainly i will be out there strongly campaigning for a'yes' vote,\" he said. \"we believe the social issues are very important of all of your [company] stakeholders and are very important for this country.\" Australians will be asked their views on same-sex marriage through a voluntary, non-binding ballot to begin next month. If it shows support for changing australia's marriage act, it is expected that a vote in parliament will follow. However, mps would not be bound to vote in line with the public. Mr joyce was one of 20 company chief executives who signed a petition in march calling on prime minister malcolm turnbull to legalise same-sex marriage. It led to criticism by immigration minister peter dutton, who said it was \"unacceptable that people would use companies and the money of publicly-listed companies to throw their weight around\". \"if alan joyce and any other ceo wants to campaign on this or any other issue in their own time and on their own dime, good luck to them,\" mr dutton said at the time. Two months later, mr joyce was giving a speech in perth when an intruder shoved him in the face with a meringue pie. \"from my reading, it would appear that alan joyce is very much part of a network trying to subvert the federal parliamentary process around the issue of marriage equality,\" the intruder, tony overheu, told the australian broadcasting corp. mr joyce later said he would press charges against mr overheu. Polls in recent years have shown a majority of australians support same-sex marriage.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe chief executive of australian airline qantas, alan joyce, has said he will campaign for the country to legalise same-sex marriage.\n\n",

Concerns were raised after the youngster drew a picture of a man cutting the vegetable. Staff in luton told the child's mother they believed he was saying \"cooker bomb\" instead of \"cucumber\". The case was sent to a police and social services panel instead of de-radicalisation scheme channel. It decided not to take further action. The boy's mother, who has not been named to protect her son's identity, concluded the confusion was due to the way her son pronounced the word. \"she (the member of nursery staff) kept saying it was this one picture of the man cutting the cucumber....which she said to me is a'cooker bomb', and i was baffled,\" she told the bbc asian network.

La gommeuse achieved the top price of $67.5m (£45m) at sotheby's, as part of their impressionist & modern art sale on thursday. And van gogh's atmospheric landscape, paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (£36m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (£203m). Simon shaw, co-head of impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it \"a small sale that packed a real punch\". He added: \"each season picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two blue period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper.\" La gommeuse, described as most the important blue period picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901. The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into english as'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs. It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work. The caricature of picasso's friend pere manach was apparently intended as a gift for the catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the boulevard de clichy in paris. The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers. At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons. The $306.7m (£202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (£182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (£244.5m). This total brings sotheby's sales of impressionist & modern art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (£381m),. Earlier this year, picasso's women of algiers became the most expensive painting to sell at auction, going for $160m (£102.6m) at christie's in new york.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA portrait by pablo picasso has become the most expensive painting to sell at auction in new york.\n\n",

Six authorities have told bbc wales a meltdown in waste markets has hit their budgets. Pembrokeshire council has seen the price it gets for steel drop by 88% over the year - while flintshire has seen the price for plastics halved. Experts say a slump in oil prices, cheap steel imports, and china's economic slowdown are to blame. \"we try to play the markets as best we can,\" harvey mitchell, the waste services manager for flintshire, said. \"it makes it difficult when we do have a drop in issues we can't control, such as the global price of oil, or when larger countries flood the european market with steel.\" Flintshire has been celebrating a record year for recycling household waste - up to 58% of everything thrown away now ends up at its waste recover facility in buckley. \"but while we've seen an increase in the amount of material we've collected, we've actually seen a drop in the income because of the market prices,\" mr mitchell said. Recycled waste netted the council £537,000 in revenue in 2015/16, but this represented a drop of 45% in the expected income - more than £400,000 in lost cash. The pattern has been repeated in pembrokeshire, where £360,000 has been wiped off the council's expected income, while four other councils saw a combined drop of £335,000. \"this is an issue which is impacting upon wales as a whole, not just pembrokeshire,\" a council official there said. \"fortunately quotes for the coming months are starting to look more positive with prices starting to increase.\" The impact on most of the other welsh councils which responded to bbc wales has been minimal, as they said are tied into long term contracts dealing with their recycling services. But one academic expert said authorities and the public in wales will need to refocus as they face ever increasing targets on recycling. By 2025 welsh authorities are being asked to recycle 70% of waste - by 2050, it should be 100%. \"waste prevention is what this is all about,\" rebecca colley-jones, from bangor university's sustainability lab, said. \"it's about buying smartly, being able to think about what you do with it so it can be reused, because reuse is a form of waste prevention. \"together we can provide solutions for the future.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nMore than £ 400,000 has been wiped off the income of some welsh councils dealing with recycling services.\n\n",

Anthony was dubbed \"america's most hated mom\" amid reports she went to nightclubs and got a tattoo in the month her daughter was missing. Last week the former judge that presided over the case spoke out to say that anthony \"more than likely\" accidently killed her daughter by using too much chloroform to calm her before suffocating her with duct tape. During the trial, her defence argued that the girl drowned in the pool, and that anthony and her father covered it up.

On monday the austin resident used a golf buggy to pick some of them up. The sure walk project has been set up to ensure students get back safely from campus when it is dark. Mcconaughey, 47, graduated from the university in 1993. He is an avid fan of its american football team. A photograph of him dressed in an orange shirt driving smiling and startled students home was posted by the university on social media. Matthew mcconaughey: from rom-com star to oscar winner. \"longhorns take care of each other, and it's'safe' to say matthew mcconaughey agrees,\" a post on the university's facebook page says. \"don't forget to use sure walk when travelling home late at night; you never know who might pick you up!\" Sure walk - or students united for rape elimination - provides students of the university of texas at austin with \"volunteer companionship while walking home from campus\". It expanded its services earlier this month from 7pm to 2am every day of the week, the university's news magazine said. It provides students with \"peace-of-mind when studying late at night and ensure[s] safety for all\". Canada police to punish drink-drivers with nickelback.

Lance corporal joseph scott pemberton was convicted of killing jennifer laude in a hotel room in olongapo city, north-west of manila, last year. Pemberton will face between six and 12 years imprisonment. The case has strained ties between the us and the philippines, a former us colony where the americans have a significant military presence. The marine was on leave in olongapo on 11 october 2014, after joint military exercises with the philippine army, when he met ms laude in a bar. Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet. Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked ms laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room. The prosecution had argued pemberton should be convicted of murder, but the court downgraded this to homicide. Pemberton was also ordered to pay at least 4.5 million pesos ($95,350; â£63,140) to ms laude's family. Ms laude's sister, malou, told reuters news agency: \"we expected a murder conviction but instead got homicide. We are not content with the decision.\" Pemberton will be temporarily detained in a philippine jail until the philippine and us governments agree on where he should be held during his prison term. The case has led to calls from left-wing groups for the philippines to end its military agreements with the us. Under the agreement, the philippines can prosecute us military personnel but the us retains custody over them \"from the commission of the offence until completion of all judicial proceedings\", the associated press reports.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA us marine has been found guilty of killing a transgender woman in the philippines.\n\n",

The study says girls as young as 10 are forced to marry much older men in countries including afghanistan, yemen, india and somalia. Save the children says early marriage can trigger a cycle of disadvantage across every part of a girl's life. Conflict, poverty and humanitarian crises are seen as major factors that leave girls exposed to child marriage. \"child marriage starts a cycle of disadvantage that denies girls the most basic rights to learn, develop and be children,\" said save the children international ceo helle thorning-schmidt. \"girls who marry too early often can't attend school, and are more likely to face domestic violence, abuse and rape. They fall pregnant and are exposed to stis (sexually transmitted infections) including hiv.\" The girl who said no to child marriage. Europe struggles with migrant child brides. Gambia and tanzania ban child marriages. Big money for niger's child brides. The report, called every last girl, ranks countries based on the hardest place to be a girl based on schooling, child marriage, teen pregnancy, maternal deaths and the number of women in parliament. Chad, niger, central african republic, mali and somalia were ranked at the bottom of the index. The report says girls affected by conflict are more likely to become child brides. It says many refugee families marry off their daughters as a way to protect them against poverty or sexual exploitation. The charity used the example of a 13-year-old syrian refugee in lebanon it called sahar - not her real name - who was married to a 20-year-old man. Now 14, she is two months pregnant. \"the wedding day, i was imagining it would be a great day but it wasn't. It was all misery. It was full of sadness,\" save the children quoted her as saying. \"i feel really blessed that i am having a baby. But i am a child raising a child.\" The report says girls also suffer during humanitarian crises such as the ebola outbreak in sierra leone where the shutting down of schools led to an estimated 14,000 teen pregnancies. The un children's agency, unicef, estimates that the number of women married in childhood will grow from 700 million today to around 950 million by 2030. The save the children's report coincides with international day of the girl on tuesday.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe world is the hardest place to be a girl, according to a new report by the charity save the children.\n\n",

The woman, named only as uzma, was escorted across the wagah border by indian high commission officials. She has accused her husband, tahir ali, of torturing her. He denies the allegations. The incident comes amid increasing tension between india and pakistan. On thursday, india's foreign minister sushma swaraj tweeted, welcoming her return:. Pakistani security officials escorted uzma, who is in her early 20s, to the border crossing in the morning. She arrived in delhi later in the day. Uzma's return comes as india and pakistan trade accusations over violence in disputed kashmir, territory which both countries claim. Tensions also rose after pakistan sentenced an indian national, kulbhushan jadhav, to death on charges of spying. On her arrival in delhi, uzma described pakistan as \"a death trap\". \"i've seen women who go there after arranged marriages. They're miserable and living in terrible circumstances. There're two, three, even four wives in every house,\" she told a press conference. \"if i'd remained there for a few days more, i would have died.\" Uzma met tahir ali in malaysia and fell in love with him, according to reports. She then travelled to pakistan earlier this month where, she said, she was forced into marriage on 3 may. While there is enough evidence to suggest that uzma came to pakistan of her own accord, it remains unclear why she changed her mind. Tahir ali has said that his father sponsored uzma's visa for pakistan after the couple met in malaysia and decided to get married. Uzma's contention that she was married at \"gunpoint\" sits uneasily against the fact that she, along with mr ali and his relatives, had visited a district court in buner town to get married. The official who performed the wedding says she appeared to participate willingly in the ceremony. Mr ali has alleged that indian officials at the high commission forced her to change her mind. On 12 may, uzma filed an appeal in the islamabad high court, accusing her husband of harassing and intimidating her, and taking away her travel documents to stop her from leaving pakistan. She told the court that he had not told her that he was a married father of four and that she had been \"terribly beaten... tortured physically and mentally\". Uzma also has a five-year-old daughter from an earlier marriage. Her lawyer requested that the court should allow her to go back to india, saying her daughter was thalassaemic and needed daily blood transfusions. Mr ali told bbc's m ilyas khan in islamabad that the charges against him were false - he said she had known about his marital status and was \"disappointed\" that he was not allowed to speak to her under court's supervision. He said he was \"confident\" that she would get in touch with him once the dust had settled.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAn indian woman who says she was forced into marriage by her husband in pakistan has returned home.\n\n",

If confirmed by the senate, james comey will replace outgoing director robert mueller iii, serving for 10 years. At the white house, mr obama praised mr comey as a model of \"fierce independence and deep integrity\". Mr comey is known for successfully opposing a warrantless wiretapping programme backed by other bush aides. Mr mueller took up his post shortly before the 9/11 attacks and is retiring as director on 4 september. In remarks on friday, mr obama said the outgoing director had displayed \"a steady hand and strong leadership\" during his time at the head of the fbi. The us president said mr comey had \"law enforcement in his blood\". \"as a young prosecutor in the us attorney's office in manhattan he helped bring down the gambino crime family; as a federal prosecutor in virginia he led an aggressive effort to combat gun violence that reduced homicide rates and saved lives,\" mr obama said. He also joked that mr comey - who is 6ft, 8in tall (2.03m) -  was \"a man who stands up very tall for justice and the rule of law\". The nominee said he could not describe his excitement to work again with the fbi. \"they are men and women who have devoted their lives to serving and protecting others and i simply can't wait to be their colleague,\" he said. One of the most dramatic episodes of mr comey's tenure as deputy attorney general in the bush administration came in 2004, when then-attorney general john ashcroft was ill in hospital. Mr bush's white house counsel alberto gonzales and chief of staff andrew card pressed him in his hospital bed to re-authorise a controversial programme allowing federal agents to eavesdrop on phone conversations without a warrant. Mr comey, who was acting as attorney general in mr ashcroft's stead, rushed to the hospital and intervened. Changes were subsequently made to the programme and mr comey drew wide praise. Mr obama alluded to the incident on friday, saying mr comey \"was prepared to give up a job he loved rather than be part of something he felt was fundamentally wrong\". After leaving the bush administration, mr comey was general counsel for bridgewater associates, a hedge fund in the us state of connecticut. He now lectures at columbia university law school in new york. Before he became deputy attorney general, mr comey had a long tenure at the justice department, serving in many posts including as us attorney for the southern district of new york.\n\nSENTENCE:\nUs president barack obama has nominated a former deputy attorney general to be the next director of the fbi.\n\n",

Fire, police and coastguard teams were called to butley creek near orford, suffolk, on wednesday by a member of the public who had seen the supine figure of a man lying in the water. The \"body\" turned out to be a work of art called a thousand tides, which has been at the site for more than a year. A suffolk police spokesman described the work as \"quite realistic\". Read more suffolk stories here. The sculpture, by artist laurence edwards, was designed to only be seen at low tide and was intended to sink eventually. However, mr edwards said it had \"stayed on the surface longer than it should\". He said: \"i've always been a bit worried that a helicopter would spot it and want to rescue it. \"to convince someone it's a real person is a great achievement, although i would like to apologise to the poor person who called it in.\" The sculpture was a parting gift to the area from mr edwards, who had a studio and foundry works nearby for 15 years until spring 2016 before moving to halesworth. Mr edwards' website says his work \"attempts to do justice to the locality and its history, by peopling it with large figures that have survived the ravages of the water and the elements.\" Suffolk police confirmed they attended butley creek, saying: \"police received a call from a member of the public reporting what they believed to be a body in the river. \"the fire service and coastguard were also called to assist, but a short while later this was actually confirmed to be a sculpture.\" A thousand tides is reminiscent of antony gormley's another place installation on crosby beach in merseyside, which depicts 100 bronze figures looking out over the irish sea.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA body found in a river was actually a sculpture, police have said.\n\n",

Originally built by henry viii to defend the coast from invasion, hurst castle was also used to guard the solent during world war two. The £1m conservation project will repair parts of the castle added in the 20th century. English heritage said it would ensure the site was \"protected for the future\". Hurst castle was originally built by henry viii between 1541 and 1544 to guard the needles passage, the narrow western entrance between the isle of wight and the mainland. In the 1860s two huge wing batteries were added. During world wars one and two the castle was fully garrisoned guarding the western entrance to the solent. The conservation project will centre on the wartime look-out tower, gun emplacements and searchlight position on top of the wing batteries. English heritage properties curator roy porter said: \"we're looking at the concrete structures added around 1902 and also to the top of the castle in the 1940s. \"these were thrown up in a hurry at a time of national emergency. Our job is to make these temporary structures permanent and protected for the future.\" The castle will remain open to the public during the work.

Four taliban gunmen were killed in the gunfight after an argument on the outskirts of quetta, a source said. Another report said mullah mansour died but this is unconfirmed. A taliban spokesman denied the gunfight happened. Mullah mansour's appointment prompted splits in the taliban after its founder mullah omar's death emerged in july. A number of senior taliban commanders refused to pledge allegiance to him and a faction opposed to him was set up last month under mullah mohammad rasool. Read more. The taliban source said the firing seemed to be spontaneous rather than planned. Several other taliban sources told the bbc that mullah mansour and his bodyguards had been at the house of another militant, abdullah sarhadi, when fighting broke out. Sarhadi is a taliban figure with symbolic importance after spending years in us detention in guantanamo bay, reports the bbc's dawood azami. Compared to mullah omar, his secretive predecessor, mullah mansour has adopted an open approach and has met taliban commanders regularly to discuss their policy concerns, our correspondent says. What prompted the shooting in quetta is unclear. \"during the discussion, some senior people developed differences and they opened fire at each other,\" said a senior taliban commander, reuters reports. Taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid categorically rejected the reports. \"no such incident has happened, because he is in afghanistan not in the area of pakistan  they have mentioned. Secondly his security is not weak to allow such an incident,\" he told the bbc afghan service. Mullah omar died in 2013 but his death was only confirmed in july. News of his death disrupted fledgling peace talks between the afghan government and the taliban. Some senior taliban leaders had been suspicious of mullah mansour's support for peace talks hosted by neighbouring pakistan, and accused pro-pakistani circles of installing him as the new leader. Since august mullah mansour has overseen a series of battlefield victories, including briefly capturing the northern afghan city of kunduz - a huge setback for western-backed afghan forces. But the islamist movement has split into openly warring factions since mullah omar died. Recent reports suggest one of the leaders of the breakaway taliban faction, mullah dadullah, was killed in recent fighting with militants loyal to mullah mansour.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe afghan taliban leader, mullah akhtar mansour, and his bodyguards have been shot dead in pakistan, officials say.\n\n",

The organisation said that councils stood \"ready, willing and able to take at least 2,000 refugees\". All 32 local authorities have agreed to support a \"coordinated response\" to the humanitarian crisis. But not all council areas may end up receiving refugees due to the complex needs of those arriving. At least 18 local authorities could see the first groups of people arriving before christmas, cosla said. The unhcr estimates that 520,000 asylum seekers have arrived in europe by sea so far this year, most braving dangerous journeys from north africa and turkey as they flee the conflict in syria. The scottish government has pledged to accept at least 2,000 of the 20,000 refugees which the uk government has agreed to take. Cosla president david o'neill said there had been an \"unprecedented response\" from scottish local government to the crisis. He added: \"a number of councils had already been in discussions with the home office about their involvement in the syrian vulnerable persons relocation scheme. \"the last three weeks has seen all scotland's councils willing to support a coordinated response to what can only be described as a humanitarian crisis. \"for many councils that has seen them committing to taking refugees immediately.\" Glasgow city council was one of a small number of councils across the uk that had already taken in syrian refugees, with more than a quarter of refugees that have arrived in the uk through the scheme being housed there. Cosla said scotland's local authorities had an excellent track record in supporting the most vulnerable in society and already had effective systems and partnerships in place which makes them well placed to host syrian refugees in their communities. But it said it recognised the scale of the task and the need for detailed planning. Cosla spokesman harry mcguigan said: \"we fully recognise that this is not simply about matching people to houses, and that we must meet the wider needs of people so that they can integrate into our communities and build a safe life in scotland. \"the response to this crisis will therefore be focused on balancing the urgency of the situation with planning the most appropriate ways in which councils and their community planning partners receive and integrate these extremely vulnerable people.\" Cosla called on the home office and the scottish government to ensure the programme is fully resourced so that local authorities and partners in areas such as health, the police and the voluntary sector could put appropriate services in place to meet the needs of refugees.\n\nSENTENCE:\nScotland's local authorities are ready to take in syrian refugees, according to the scottish councils association ( cosla ).\n\n",

While 7% of people underpay and could be fined, 13% are paying too much. The office of rail and road (orr) wants train companies to refund passengers who accidentally buy tickets that are too expensive for their journey. Train operators said that vending machines were designed for simple ticket requirements. They say plans to simplify fares will help them to give clearer information on ticket machines. The orr employed mystery shoppers to buy rail tickets from machines. \"despite investment in new technology and the removal of jargon from ticket machines, our new research shows passengers may be paying more for their journey than necessary,\" said john larkinson, orr director of railway markets and economics. \"we are calling on train companies to commit to refund anyone who finds that they could have bought a cheaper ticket for the same journey,\" he added. Rail operators c2c and scotrail already have a price guarantee in place for when passengers overpay. Earlier this month, the rail delivery group (rdg), which represents train operators, announced a trial scheme to simplify fares. It said the 16 million fares on offer were \"baffling\" for passengers. As part of the trial, which begins in may, ticket machines on stations will also be updated, to make sure they show the cheapest fares available. \"to quickly benefit passengers, the rail delivery group must set out what improvements to ticket machines will be made in the short term,\" said mr larkinson. Paul plummer, chief executive of the rdg, told the bbc that operators were aware that there was a problem with machines, and that they had formulated a 10-point plan to improve them. Yet he pointed out the machines were designed as \"queue-busters\" for passengers with relatively simple requirements, but \"expectations [of passengers] had evolved\". He said that the system of fares was far too complicated. The rdg also added: \"complex, decades-old government rail fare regulations make it more difficult for train companies to offer the right, simple options on ticket machines. \"simplifying the number and types of fares in the system will let train companies provide customers with clear information and help them to make better informed choices,\" they added. By ben morris, business reporter. In the british rail era, rail fares were a relatively simple affair, with ticket prices worked out on a cost-per mile basis. But in the 1990s, in an effort to make the network more efficient, the operation of rail services was handed to private train operating companies (tocs). The tocs were given some freedom to set ticket prices, with advanced ticket bookings particularly important to them, as it helps them to keep their trains full. To protect passengers, other fares were regulated, including season tickets and off-peak fares. The result is a patchwork of fares, that becomes even more complicated when a passenger wants to cross several train regions. Savvy travellers have been taking advantage of this by splitting their journey into several tickets, rather than one through-ticket.\n\nSENTENCE:\nMore than a quarter of rail passengers are paying more for their journey than they need to, according to new research.\n\n",

Stormont officials have refused to give any details citing confidentiality. Homeowners will not face bills until at least march 2017, after mlas ruled to defer charges. Instead, the executive pays the cost of â£280m a year to ni water. Further legislation is expected to extend the policy. However, the decision could mean that the authorities are not complying with european rules on water quality. The eu water framework directive envisages that users should pay for their water to promote conservation. Officials in northern ireland make the case that people do that through their regional rate. Northern ireland is the only part of the uk not to levy a charge on homes, although businesses do pay charges. That has prompted a debate with calls for the introduction of a charge on homes to pay for improvements in infrastructure. Now, the european commission has opened a so-called \"pilot case\" to look at the issue. Essentially, this is a way for the commission to establish whether eu rules are being correctly applied. It allows for the commission and member states to resolve any conflicts without resorting to infringement proceedings. The department of agriculture environment and rural affairs (daera) said it could not comment on the detail of the case. \"it is the subject of a confidential dialogue with the commission and the release of further details could potentially prejudice the outcome of those discussions,\" said the department. The two sides get about 20 weeks to try and sort out their differences. Many cases are resolved without going to a formal hearing.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe european commission is investigating whether the northern ireland executive is breaking eu rules on water charges.\n\n",

The firm successfully completed operational trials of the train 2 unit ahead of it receiving shale gas ethane from the us this autumn. New docks and a new pipeline network have been built to receive the gas. The company said the move means it is now in \"great shape\" to run the plant at full capacity. The kg ethylene cracker was unable to operate at full capacity in 2008, leaving ineos \"no option\" but to close the second manufacturing unit. Ineos said the us ethane will be used as a supplementary feed for the kg ethylene plant and will allow the plant to run at increased rates. Gordon milne, ineos grangemouth operations director, said: \"with the successful completion of the train 2 trial we are now in great shape to receive shale gas from the us and to finally run the grangemouth plant at full rates. \"all the parts of the jigsaw are finally coming together and grangemouth will soon be back in the premier league of european petrochemical plants.\" The plant's chief executive john mcnally said: \"bringing the site back into profitability is the best way to secure our future here in scotland. \"we know that ethane from us shale gas has transformed us manufacturing and we are now a step closer to seeing this advantage being brought to here to grangemouth.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nIneos has said it is a step closer to restarting the kg ethylene cracker in grangemouth.\n\n",

The world number two won 6-2 6-0 in 66 minutes and will next play rafael nadal, who beat stan wawrinka 6-1 6-4. It was a much improved performance from murray, who broke 10th seed raonic's serve five times. Jo-wilfried tsonga beat roger federer 6-3 2-6 7-5, and fellow frenchman gael monfils beat marcel granollers 6-2 6-4. \"it's the most challenging surface for me every year,\" said murray. \"it normally takes me a few weeks to remember what i need to do, how to move, the way to build up the points and making sure you don't rush.\" Murray needed almost three hours to beat benoit paire on thursday and had struggled for form since the australian open in january - but he was close to his best against raonic. The scot, 28, dominated all aspects of the game but was especially aggressive on the return, denying the big-serving raonic a single ace and breaking five times. \"the two most important shots in tennis i did really well,\" added murray. \"i was getting a good read on the serve and, when he missed the first serve, i was being very offensive on the second serve return and putting him under pressure. \"the serve and the return for me were the best they've been for a while and i'm glad, because they weren't so strong the last couple of matches.\" Jamie murray boosted his hopes of hanging on to the doubles world number one spot for a while longer as he and brazil's bruno soares reached the semi-finals. The pair beat sixth seeds rohan bopanna and florin mergea 6-2 6-3, despite murray requiring treatment on his thigh at one stage. Murray leads marcelo melo by just five points in the rankings and will face the brazilian, and partner ivan dodig of croatia, in the last four on saturday. Andy murray and dom inglot had a match point but could not convert as they lost 6-4 3-6 12-10 to france's in-form nicolas mahut and pierre-hugues. Never want to miss the latest tennis news?

Mooboo bubble tea - which sells the taiwanese drink topped with tapioca balls - was attacked on social media and by campaign groups. A petition to demand it pay staff properly collected more than 40,000 signatures. In a statement, mooboo said trainees would now be paid \"company set levels\". Emails outlining the original terms were leaked to campaign organisation 38 degrees. Gordon maloney from the group said it was an \"outrageous way for mooboo bubble tea to exploit people looking for work\". He welcomed the \"turnaround\" but said it was \"very important to us that people who have worked for the chain for free under this policy should also be recompensed\". The company has branches in london, birmingham, bradford, coventry, gateshead, hatfield, leeds, liverpool, manchester and glasgow. Successful interview applicants were offered 40 hours training, but warned this did not guarantee a job. Mooboo said in a statement: \"in view of the recent feedbacks, we are prepared to implement a new training process which all trainees will be paid according to our company set levels once the trainee has entered into our training contract.\" It later confirmed to campaign group betterthanzero that all staff would be paid at least the minimum wage from \"the first hour\". The furore over the training contract led to other cafes being confused with the firm. Bubble boba in coventry \"suffered vandalism to our shop, slander and abuse to our staff\", it said. Directors neil and kristin mccoy-ward said it was now \"mooboo's duty to set the example and follow uk regulations and pay bubble tea artists correctly for their work\".\n\nSENTENCE:\nA bubble tea chain has promised to pay its trainees at least the minimum wage after it was criticised for offering free training.\n\n",

The victim was fatally injured outside a property on daniel hill terrace, upperthorpe, close to the city centre. People living in the area said the man was either in, or close to, a black mercedes car he had been driving when he was shot. Officers, called to the scene at about 13:35 gmt, found the man with a gunshot wound to his chest. Armed police sealed off the area. The victim was taken to northern general hospital but died from his injuries. Local residents said the man was a member of a family who live close to the scene of the shooting. They said relatives had been gathering for a family celebration when the attack occurred. Many came out of the house to try to help him after hearing the shot, neighbours said. There have been a number of shootings in sheffield in recent weeks, although all the previous incidents have been in the north of the city and not close to the upperthorpe area.

Elin jones is expected to lay out plans where some areas of welsh forest could be transferred to the private sector or to not for profit organisations. But she has already ruled out the widespread sale of welsh woodlands. Forestry commission wales said it would explore the feasibility of transfer to the private sector case by case. The minister told bbc radio wales she plans to \"compensate\" the public by buying new land for new planting or management if any forest was sold off on a case-by-case basis. \"i don't want any stagnancy in the forest estate. I want it to work for public benefit whether that's economic or environmental or access benefit,\" she said. \"it's my view there should be no reduction in the publicly owned estate and i have asked the forestry commission to look at how it can make that estate work harder, provide a better return for the public. \"whether that's in terms of public access, in terms of environmental benefit in the production of renewable energy or biomass potential or also in terms of the economic return from that forestry estate.\" The minister is due to outline her plans to ams during tuesday's plenary session in the senedd. Further commercialisation being planned would include partnerships with the private sector for more forest holidays, wind farms and limited extraction of coalfield methane. Around 37% of welsh woodland comes under the assembly government woodland estate (agwe). A report commissioned by the assembly examined a number of options, including a complete sell-off of the land to the private sector or a not-for-profit trust. It warned there were potential difficulties with both of these, instead recommending that a case-by-case approach should be taken to the future of wales' forests. Jerry langford, the woodland trust's director in wales gave a guarded welcome and said the plans were \"considered and enlightened\". \"if these changes do lead to more native woodland creation and a new urgency for the restoration of ancient woodlands planted with conifers, this could be the start of a new'age of the tree' in wales,\" he said. Any sell-off in wales would release resources to the fc to purchase other areas of land not currently under its management to increase their public benefit. Overall, there would be no reduction in the size of the welsh forests in public ownership. The report states: \"the minister agreed that fc wales should adopt whenever possible a more commercial approach to its management of the estate and in particular to be pro-active and imaginative in exploring opportunities for deeper commercialisation when dealing with the private sector.\" Forestry commission wales said it would \"explore the feasibility of small-scale transfer to the third sector on a case by case basis\". A spokesman said: \"this would be subject to proper safeguards being in place to ensure that the woodland continues to be sustainably managed and that it can continue to deliver key benefits such as access for the public.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nThere will be no reduction in the size of wales' forests, the environment minister has said.\n\n",

Alistair spagnoletti, 21, of luton, and curtis walker, 23, of watford, pleaded guilty to controlling a child at harrow crown court. Callum ward, 19, of watford, was found guilty of the same charge. Police said the men groomed a 17-year-old girl into prostitution in one of the most \"damaging\" cases of child sexual exploitation they had seen. Det sgt iain macpherson, of hertfordshire police, said: \"this is one of the most damaging cases of child sexual exploitation we have encountered in hertfordshire. \"it has also been an extremely complex case. These men had groomed their 17-year-old victim into having sex with men for money which they took, she believed that by providing her with food, drink, drugs, they were looking after her and they were people she could trust. \"the power they wielded over her was so great that she felt she could not support police action against them. Sadly she may never recover from what they have done to her. \"these acts are deplorable and i am in no doubt these men pose a risk to other children. It is right they are now serving time in prison.\" Spagnoletti, of wauluds drive, luton, was jailed for six years and eight months. Walker, of lord street, watford, was jailed for four and a half years and ward, of the thrums, watford, was jailed for two years.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThree men who groomed a teenager into prostitution have been jailed.\n\n",

Bedene, 26, battled past spain's carreno busta, ranked 23 places higher at 43rd in the world, in five sets, winning 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 4-6 5-7 6-2. It was an impressive show of resolve from the slovenia-born player, who surrendered a two-set advantage. However, he recovered his poise, ending the match with 23 aces. Compatriot andy murray reached the third round with victory over mathias bourgue on wednesday. \"the last few months haven't been the best and i have been struggling but i'm really proud of what i have achieved so far,\" said bedene. \"it meant a lot to win. \"i have only played one fifth set before - in wimbledon last year, and i won it - and it wasn't easy after being two love up but it shows i am fit enough and i am really proud.\" Hindered by a thigh injury, busta struggled to cover the court in the final stages, but bedene's performance was full of grit and determination as he showed he could mix it with a european clay-court specialist. Djokovic is yet to drop a set at the tournament after easing aside belgium's steve darcis 7-5 6-3 6-4 to advance. Bedene lost his only previous meeting with the serb, succumbing in straight sets at the 2015 australian open. However, the welwyn garden city-based right-hander has risen from world number 116 to 66th in the world since then. Bbc tennis correspondent russell fuller. \"this was an excellent victory by bedene because he was up against a fine clay-court player and because he admits his confidence is fragile after winning only two main-draw matches in five tournaments before roland garros. \"his 23 aces were the bedrock of victory, along with his ability to draw busta away from his comfort zone behind the baseline by using the drop shot.\" Subscribe to the bbc sport newsletter to get our pick of news, features and video sent to your inbox.\n\nSENTENCE:\nBritish number three aljaz bedene beat pablo carreno busta to reach the french open third round, where he will face world number one novak djokovic.\n\n",

The attacker made the devices print a warning urging their owners to cut off remote access. Large printers in offices, domestic devices and tiny receipt printers in restaurants were all caught up in the hack. The attack came soon after a german academic study found vulnerabilities in a wide range of printers. Over the weekend, a hacker using the alias stackoverflowin ran an automated program that scoured the internet for printers that did not have basic security controls switched on. Once it discovered a vulnerable device, the program made them print a page announcing the invasion and telling the owner to close the \"port\" used to hijack it. \"for the love of god, please close this port, skid [script kiddie, ie novice coder],\" said the message. Early versions of the program also added ascii art depicting different robots or a computer. Also included were an email address and a twitter handle for stackoverflowin. Many people posted pictures of the printed messages to social media and asked questions about what was happening on technical support forums and social networks such as reddit. Printers made by hp, brother, epson, canon, lexmark, minolta and many others were hit by stackoverflowin's program. The hacker said he did not intend to abuse the access he had gained to the printers. \"i'm about helping people to fix their problem, but having a bit of fun at the same time,\" he told the bleeping computer tech news website. \"everyone's been cool about it and thanked me to be honest.\" Last week, computer security researchers jens muller, vladislav mladenov and juraj somorovsky, from the ruhr university, in germany, released an academic paper summarising work they had done on printer security. The trio tested 20 separate printers and found that all of them were vulnerable to at least one type of attack. They found ways to put the printers in to an endless loop so they were never available to users, or to hijack the devices so they could be used as an entry point to the computer networks on which they sat.\n\nSENTENCE:\nA hacker has hijacked a large number of high-end printers.\n\n",

The 25-year-old claimed her maiden able-bodied national title on sunday and won team gold with england at the 2010 commonwealth games. But to qualify for rio, brown would have to switch from her favoured compound bow to the recurve, something she will \"absolutely not\" do. Media playback is not supported on this device. \"i love shooting the compound and think i still have a lot to give,\" she added. \"paralympic sport is my job and i have to go out there and perform well, so that's the main thing.\" Brown's stance is backed by archerygb paralympic head coach michael peart, a former world number two in the compound who swapped to recurve in 2001 but was never able to reach the same heights before his retirement earlier this year. \"going to recurve would be a major change and it would take many years of training to go from the top of one [discipline] to the top of another. I tried, and in 10 years i never got there,\" peart, who narrowly missed out on selection for london 2012, told bbc sport. \"i think she has to concentrate on trying to maintain this paralympic success and build on that stockpile of gold medals.\" Brown will not be able to add to the team title she won at the 2010 commonwealths in delhi at glasgow 2014 after archery was left out of the programme. \"it's pretty tough knowing that archery isn't going to be in glasgow because i had such a great time in india and it was one of my first major able-bodied events,\" she told bbc sport. \"it's a big shame, but i think it's one of those cases where you have to focus on what you can do rather than what you can't.\" Brown is preparing to compete in both the able-bodied world championships in antalya, turkey (29 september-6 october) and para-archery worlds in bangkok, thailand (1-7 november).

Inspectors criticised darul uloom school when they saw a \"female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room\". But a statement from the school says the school did not segregate, but was respecting the governor's choice. A wave of ofsted inspections found nine private faith schools \"inadequate\". Ofsted chief sir michael wilshaw had written on tuesday to education secretary nicky morgan with the findings of inspections of 22 private faith schools, in cities including manchester, coventry, birmingham and leicester. These had formerly been inspected by an independent group - the bridge schools inspectorate - but from this autumn ofsted has taken over responsibility for carrying out checks. Religious studies gcse'error of law' inspectors raised concerns including that some of these private faith schools were not \"promoting fundamental british values\" and were not encouraging \"mutual respect and tolerance of those with different faiths and beliefs\". They highlighted particular concern about darul uloom islamic high school in birmingham, where inspectors observed that \"the only female governor sat out of sight of the male governors in an adjacent room to the main meeting. \"as a result, she could only contribute to the meeting through a doorway. Governors told inspectors this was their usual arrangement. \"a senior hmi has pointed out to the school that this practice is unacceptable as it fails to show proper respect for women.\" In response, a statement from the school says that visitors, parents and governors can \"sit where and how they wish as they feel comfortable, and we never assert any restrictions on this\". The private boys' schools says it has an \"open door policy\" and has hosted meetings including for a local faith forum and for the west midlands police. The school issued a statement from the unnamed governor saying that \"my request to sit as i please\" was a way of \"demonstrating the school's strong promotion of both islamic and british values\". \"the right for a person to choose is a universal value,\" she said. But she claimed that the \"british values\" requirement was opposed to this. Darul uloom, now rated as inadequate, had been inspected by ofsted inspectors since 2011. In october 2013, ofsted rated it as good and described the head teacher as \"forward thinking\". Ofsted says that although its own inspectors carried out a number of inspections in recent years, the school was considered to have been part of the bsi inspection system. Among the 22 schools inspected 15 were muslim and seven christian. They had been part of a group of about 50 private schools which had been assessed by the bridge schools inspectorate, which now is no longer approved to inspect schools. Among the 22 schools inspected by ofsted, one was \"outstanding\", four were rated \"good\", eight were rated as \"requires improvement\" and nine were \"inadequate\". Sir michael's letter to the education secretary says it should be a priority to inspect other former bridge schools inspectorate schools.\n\nSENTENCE:\nAn islamic high school in birmingham has defended its decision to allow a female governor to sit out of sight of its male governors.\n\n",

The crown estate said that leasing the sites for technology development was \"critical\" for the uk to unlock the potential of wave and tidal energy. First minister carwyn jones said the benefits could be significant in terms of the economy and renewable energy. Wales's first commercial tidal energy farm is due to launch off anglesey in summer 2016. Its electricity generators will operate like wind turbines but with blades driven by tidal wave action. Menter mon and wave hub were confirmed by the crown estate as managers for the west anglesey tidal and south pembrokeshire wave demonstration zones respectively. They will prepare and manage the sites for sub-letting to developers. In addition, development rights for a tidal site off holyhead deep have been granted to minesto. Rob hastings, director of energy and infrastructure at the crown estate said: \"by providing these additional seabed rights we are pleased to be enabling further technology development and commercialisation, which will be critical if the uk is to unlock its significant natural resources for wave and tidal current energy. \"this innovative approach to leasing the seabed sees us responding to market demand and introducing managed demonstration zones to give other organisations the opportunity to lend tangible support in their local areas.\" First minster carwyn jones said: \"the energetic waters off our coast are ideal for marine renewable energy projects. \"our ports, supply-chain infrastructure and grid infrastructure also put us in an enviable position for developing a thriving marine energy market, both as a significant generator and as an exporter of marine energy knowledge, technologies and services.\" Gareth clubb, director of friends of the earth cymru said: \"to having testing sites approved for marine renewable energy is a significant step forward.\"\n\nSENTENCE:\nSeabed rights for two wave demonstration zones off the welsh coast have been granted.\n\n",

The conservative minister said he was inviting other political parties for talks on securing \"the best possible devolution settlement for wales\". A new uk cabinet committee chaired by commons leader william hague will now meet for the first time on wednesday. Mr crabb's comments come as wales' first minister carwyn jones called for a convention on future of the uk. Speaking on tuesday at the labour party conference, mr jones said the union cannot be rebuilt through conversation between only westminster and scotland. Now the welsh secretary has pledged to keep wales at the discussion table on the future of devolved powers across britain. Mr crabb said he had already held preliminary discussions with mr hague, a former welsh secretary himself. \"we are both in absolute agreement that wales should be central to the debate that is now commencing,\" said mr crabb. \"i want us to use this opportunity positively to look again at how we secure the best possible devolution settlement for wales. \"i want to move forward in a realistic, open-minded and pragmatic way.\" Mr crabb has written to the leaders of other welsh parties at westminster inviting them to a wales office \"summit\" to discuss \"how we deliver devolution that works for wales\". The meeting is likely to take place when parliament returns next month. He said he is also arranging meetings with party leaders in the national assembly to ensure their views feed into the debate. The comments from mr crabb came as prime minister david cameron hosted discussions with backbench tory mps at his chequers country residence. One of the two welsh mps to attend was the aberconway mp, guto bebb. He said events in scotland have \"completely changed the nature of the debate\" on devolution. Key to monday's talks have been the issue of \"english votes for english laws\", which would see welsh and scottish mps excluded from voting on devolved matters in the house of commons. That has led to labour party leader ed miliband accusing mr cameron of planning to set the uk nations against each other. But the aberconway mp said he took a different view. \"the promises made to scotland must be delivered upon and if they are delivered on then we are going to end up in my view with english votes for english laws and that in my view is a simple matter of fairness,\" said mr bebb.\n\nSENTENCE:\nWelsh secretary stephen crabb has said wales should be central to the debate on the future of the uk.\n\n",

Some 563 were held or arrested by port of dover police officers last year - up from 148 in 2013, a bbc radio kent freedom of information request shows. The figures come days after dozens of migrants attempted to storm the channel tunnel's calais terminal. The home office said it was providing funding to bolster security and that many crossing attempts had been foiled. The foi shows 46 illegal immigrants were detained or arrested at dover - one of the main gateways to britain - between january and april this year. The number of detentions and arrests is also up significantly from 2012, when 105 were held or arrested. Around 3,000 migrants from countries including eritrea, syria and afghanistan are camped at a site dubbed \"the jungle ii\" near the port of calais. French aid workers have reported a \"catastrophic\" situation there. Road haulage association chief executive richard burnett, who recently visited calais, said migrants are going to great lengths to cross the channel. He told radio kent: \"they think it's a great place to be and (britain's) their target. They will do anything they possibly can to get into the uk.\" Last week, channel tunnel services were delayed and cancelled after immigrants entered restricted areas on the french side. And last month hundreds of migrants tried to board uk-bound lorries amid chaos as a strike forced the suspension of services through the tunnel. Eurotunnel said at the time that the number of migrants in the calais area was the \"highest ever\". Hauliers have been advised by the freight transport association not to stop within about 60 miles (97km) of calais, to stick with other drivers and make sure padlocks are always kept on vehicles. Responding to the latest figures, a home office spokesman said 40,000 attempted illegal crossings of the channel had been foiled last year. He added: \"we are providing funding to bolster the security of ports in northern france and belgium, including a â£2m upgrade of detection technology, a â£1m extension of dog searching capacity and â£12m to reinforce security at calais and other ports. \"during the current period of disruption to cross-channel services, border force has put its contingency plans into operation to ensure security is maintained. \"we have deployed additional border force staff and sniffer dogs in northern france as well as bolstering screening checks at dover for both tourist and freight vehicles.\" The port of dover police is a non-home office constabulary funded entirely by the port authority, dover harbour board. Port of dover police is not responsible for border security, which is down to the border agency and kent police frontier operations.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe number of illegal immigrants detained or arrested at the uk's busiest port has more than doubled in a year, figures show.\n\n",

An action on hearing loss cymru survey found many job seekers are reluctant to list it on job applications. The charity spoke to one deaf person who had not had an interview in 16 years of stating they were deaf on cvs. Many public sector organisations were found to show poor practice in the report to mark deaf awareness week. Maggie hampton of fairwater, cardiff, told bbc radio wales that she found it \"very disheartening.\" In the interview she said: \"it was very very difficult. Nobody wanted to employ a deaf person. Even in the most lowly of jobs really. I never got interviews. I just never heard back. \"i did follow it up with one organisation and asked'why have i not got an interview?' And the reply was'well you are deaf, you couldn't possibly manage.' \"so i did cleaning for two or three years, it was the only thing i could do. \"i didn't like it very much but i did it because i needed to work. \"it was very hard and very disheartening. Just that feeling that nobody wants you. And that feeling that you cannot contribute anything.\" She  said many deaf people do not declare the fact on their cvs as they \"want to fit in\". Action on hearing loss cymru director richard williams said 84,000 people, or 4% of wales' working-age population, are deaf or wear hearing aids. \"that's the equivalent to filling the millennium stadium with people who are all being discriminated against at work because they can't hear well,\" he added.\n\nSENTENCE:\nDeaf people are being discriminated against at work because they do not want to admit they are deaf, a charity has said.\n\n",

The company has been negotiating with the pension regulator and the ppf in a bid to offload its pension liabilities and a decision is expected soon. Most, if not all, members of the scheme would see a reduction in benefits. Those under retirement age would receive an immediate 10% cut in their pension pot. In addition, annual payments to most members, including those already retired, would be less in the ppf than if the hoover scheme continued. At about £500m, the pension scheme is roughly the same size as bhs. Bhs pensions is already receiving compensation from ppf which acts as a lifeboat for pensions so people are paid even when a company goes bust or is about to and if there are insufficient assets in the scheme. Bhs is being assessed for take-over by the organisation. The hoover scheme has a deficit of about £250m. Parent company hoover candy stopped producing washing machines in merthyr tydfil in 2009, blaming competition in the marketplace. More than 300 workers lost their jobs although there is still a head office and a distribution warehouse in the town. It is believed about half of the hoover pension scheme's 7,800 members live in wales. Pensions expert stuart price, partner at quantum advisory, said: \"members of the pension schemes will lose out on their benefits but, on the flipside, those still employed by the company will retain their jobs. \"at the moment they [members] don't know what's happening so they can't really plan for their short-term future. \"if they get a 10% reduction [for those under 65] and lower increases in the future they might find it very hard to overcome.\" Will you be affected by a change to the hoover pensions scheme? You can contact us in the following ways:. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a bbc journalist.\n\nSENTENCE:\nThe future of bhs's pension scheme could be decided by the pension protection fund ( ppf ).\n\n",

Mr maduro said the room would be kept intact and a wing of the presidential palace turned into a monument to mr chavez's \"bolivarian revolution\". Mr chavez died of cancer last month. Following his death, presidential elections were called for 14 april, pitting mr maduro against main opposition candidate henrique capriles. Mr capriles says that despite mr maduro's attempt at portraying himself as mr chavez's heir, the acting president lacks the late leader's charisma. \"i'm going to look after it for a few years, but it'll always be chavez's home,\" mr maduro said referring to the miraflores palace in caracas, where venezuela's presidents have their office. Full of confidence ahead of sunday's polls, mr maduro said he would \"occupy a small office in miraflores in another wing\", so that venezuelans could roam the rooms of the presidential palace and \"learn how the commander had lived, and what he had eaten\". Fierce battle. Since mr chavez died on 5 march, mr maduro has cast himself as his natural successor in office. He has called himself \"chavez's son\" and said that the late president had appeared to him in the form of a little bird. Speaking last week at the official start of the presidential campaign in the house where mr chavez was born, mr maduro said a small bird had flown around him three times and looked at him \"oddly\", at which point he he had felt in his soul it was a message from mr chavez. \"i felt its blessing, telling us:'today the battle begins, go for victory, you have my blessing',\" mr maduro said. Henrique capriles mocked mr maduro saying that he had \"not seen a little bird, but swallowed one, the one he has in his head!\" He has also questioned mr maduro's ability to lead the country saying that \"whatever the outcome, i don't see how nicolas maduro has the capacity to stay for an extended time in government\". Mr capriles has dismissed polls that suggest mr maduro has an unassailable lead over him. \"of course i can win,\" he told afp news agency, \"maduro lacks charisma and leadership\". Mr maduro said his rival was \"jealous\" and promised to beat him by 10 million votes in sunday's polls.\n\nSENTENCE:\nVenezuelan acting president nicolas maduro has said he will keep the room where he was born as a shrine to late leader hugo chavez.\n\n",
