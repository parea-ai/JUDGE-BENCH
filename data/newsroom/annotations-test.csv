By A new study that college are more likely to engage in energy - binge drinking when alcohol than non - .,Mixing energy drinks and alcohol may lead to riskier behavior,"We need a study to tell us things like this? My bad; I forgot that society no longer has common sense.</p><p>6 years ago my brother was found dead in his apartment. The only explanation the coroner gave my family was that his heart ""just stopped"", and it was most likely due to the fact that he had been drinking what you call ""energy cocktails"" with friends the night before (red bull and vodka). Drinking these things doesnt just affect your decision making skills, or cause anxiety disorders, IT CAN KILL YOU.</p><p>PLEASE, everybody who reads this, remember uppers and downers DO NOT MIX</p><p>Why? This trend has happened in the past too with other stimulants. Stimulants with depressants have a synergistic effect in some cases trippling the effect of one or the other which can have deadly consequences. The people using these combinations, one need to grow up and stop mixing drinks like little kids at a coolaid party and two wake up before they cannot wake up...they mix drinks for attention and some mystical edge that those flakes think they get from mixing energy drinks and alcohol....sad.</p><p>Energy drinks are disgusting. Why would anyone mix them with alcohol?</p><p>When i was in college we would routinly drink all night long taking caffine pills through out to stay up. Its a lot of fun, I had such good times in college, I miss it. We would also inhale aerosol room deoderizers. That just made you kinda pass out and fall down, so not as much fun. I found that if I drank all night with the caffine pills I could smoke a one hitter just before going to sleep and I wouldnt have a hangover when I woke up. I could start the process over when I woke up. I did this 5-6 nights a week on average. I graduated with a 3.4 gpa and now I have a great job making 93k per year. So there really isnt any harm in this behavior.</p><p>Another misleading study. Forget that the people that drink energy drinks and alcohol together are just more riskier. Its the caffeine and alcohol combination that makes them morons. God forbid they are morons without the combination of the two.</p><p>alcohol + energy drinks = a great time!</p><p>Alcohol must be necessary to cut the awful taste of the energy drinks.</p><p>One major flaw in this study. Are the people who partake in this risky behaviour, including mixing caffiene and alcohol, more prone to this type of behaviour to begin with?</p><p>As a former ""cherry bomb"", vodka-red bull, and jager-bomb drinker, I can appreciate the feeling you get when you drink caffiene and liquor. I never did anything extra risky when clubing and drinking these beverages. I also am not prone to risky behaviour other than the rare binge drinking.</p><p>Gee what do you know... more things that are bad for you!! What a bogus study. Too much of anything harmful to your body is going to do damage. I for one love the combo but only in moderation. Risky behavior... Give me a break! Driving your car or even going to a party or club is ""risky"" behavior. With all the sickos in the world today, no one is ever safe. Always be aware of your surroundings and always in moderation.</p><p>This article reminded me that I had a 5 hr energy drink in my computer bag. Thanks! that just saved my afternoon.</p><p>Also, I drank 2 – 5hr energies at a party last weekend and had a blast. Caffeine is what makes the world go round and alcohol makes the world a cooler place. So if my logic is correct the two combined are a match made in heaven. Drink on!</p><p>Red bull and vodka is the modern, legal, ""speedball,"" and we all know that caffeine + liquor simply equals a wide-awake drunk.</p><p>So how is this riskier than just getting drunk and then trying to sober up by drinking black coffee?</p><p>I agree with everyone who says that vodka plus Red Bull is just legal crack.</p><p>We might as well give up on the War on Drugs right now.</p><p>It's pointless to spend billions of dollars on fighting the cocaine cartels when you can just add vodka to Red Bull and get the same effect and the same damage to society from the perpetual overdoers.</p><p>Nothing new – someone once thought it was 'fun' to mix barbituates with stimulants. The fact remains, risk increases, not decreases.</p><p>It's always interesting to hear from those who justify questionable activity, whether or not it has been definitively determined to be risky. It usually begins with the phrase '...I like..', as if the ends, the effect, justifies the means, the unknown mixture, regardless of the actual risks, usually unknown.</p><p>Well, some people like pit bulls, some like shooting AK's at wildlife, some like driving SUV's like sports cars, but, none of those are conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior.</p><p>The operative word here is MAY. This is not a definitive study and, therefore, any conclusions are not empirical.</p><p>Two of the worst hangovers I have ever had were the result of just 2 or 3 vodka-redbulls... No thanks, no more, that cured me.</p><p>This indicates a link to Anxiety and Manic Depressive behavior.</p><p>I used to drink energy drinks to help recover from the previous night. I then discovered that the energy drinks + alcohol were less expensive than plain energy drinks (go figure). These became my first drinks of the day...I am now in 12 step recovery.</p><p>Who wants to live low risk their whole life? The entire USA is a country of risk/pain/consequence averse cowards. Im surprised the Amish dont take over the country. They probably would if it werent for the language barrier.</p><p>""So there really isn't any harm in this behavior."" –</p><p>You're an ignorant piece of trash, please die.</p><p>Ok, enough with people being all judgmental and comparing redbull and vodka to a freaking SPEEDBALL of heroin and cocaine. Um, not even close people. How many of you out there take your doctor-prescribed anti-anxiety pills with your morning coffee? Same thing.</p><p>And to the person who said ""pit bulls... [not] conducive to low risk, great decisions or desirable behavior"" I have a pitbull. They are VERY loving and loyal dogs. Even a poodle who is raised wrong can cause great injury to a person. I think it's irresponsible to use owning a pitbull to try and make a point about reckless behavior. You are just spreading the hate. ANY dog raised in a sick environment can turn out dangerous.</p><p>Sometimes I will have an energy beer, or do some various 'bomb' containing redbull and something 80-proof. Obviously when you're hyper and drunk, you might do stupid things. When you're drunk and tired, you might also do stupid things. I wish doctors and researchers would find a cure for cancer and AIDS and stop 'researching' all of these common sense things! Ridiculous.</p><p>I like to start the night off with a energydrink and vodka mix. one or two to get me going and then I switch to beer. I have been doing this for years and have not noticed any problems with health or risk taking.</p><p>Taste Great, but yeah uppers + downers is a bad idea</p><p>To Poppy, I think I went to college with you and was perhaps involved in the debauchery...but don't make nearly what you make, and not everyone is as lucky as you, or dodges as many life bullets as you have. word.</p><p>I am sorry to read the post about the brother who passed away, possibly related to the mixture of energy drinks and alcohol. That being said, there is an old saying....""everything in moderation""</p><p>PS – Red Bull and grape flavored Three Olives vodka is maaawney!!!</p><p>Patricia....Red Bull and vodka the same effect as cocaine? you probably have had neither because you clearly have no idea what you are talking about</p><p>Lester, redbull and vodka didn't make you an alcoholic, I guess you've missed the step about taking responsibilitiy for your own actions.</p><p>I'm a professional, a mom and a wife who every once in a while(about half a dozen times a year) is called on by friends to go out and celebrate a special occassion. Unless I'm at a party I don't ever drink (doesn't entice me) . Maybe as a product of my generation, I've been drinking this combo for almost a decade. This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.</p><p>@johnna: that's absurd. If there is any truth to your post, then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and/or sugar in the energy drink.</p><p>Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life – and never more than 1 in a single night. I no longer drink any sort of energy drink, they are just bad news all around.</p><p>So.... Vodka and Red Bull is bad, but an Irish Coffee is okay? Huh.</p><p>You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull – that stuff is just nasty – battery acid tasting. ""An acquired taste."" Sorry, no thanks.</p><p>Moderation is key. Binge drinking is just plain stupid. When you have college students who think they will live forever, try to drink a keg themselves, or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems.</p><p>Yes, first time binge drinkers can die. Yes, some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing ""serious"" happens to them, yet others imitating them can die. George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died. Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner. We may never know what kept him from having problems.</p><p>I don't drink, but if I did, I'd have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka. 14 flavors, little caffiene (6 oz coffee amt) but 5000% Vitamin B12. Yes, it could make a more awake drunk. But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later. Because it doesn't have any sugar or carbs in it. Only 8 calories a can. And no acquired taste for battery acid required. www . jve . biz pwd: nutrition</p><p>Most of these posts scare me to death for today's generation. I hope there aren't many out there like you.</p><p>My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls....a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1/2 shot tequila and 1/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink. I usually drink about 12 of these on a ""party"" night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!</p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.</p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?</p><p>Anyone ever heard of ""Rum & Coke"" before?</p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong. It is not even close to the same thing. Not even a little bit.</p><p>Hopefully they people get anxiety and depression and kill themselves before they cost all of money in the free health care they will require and get! Let's all be idiots and then make everyone else pay the price.</p><p>BRILLIANT!!!! Kids that are 25 and younger in this country are absolutely useless anyway. Hopefully they wipe themselves out and we jump right to next generation. Afterall, it is the same people that have worshiped Britany Spears, Paris Hilton, The Hills, and energy drinks.</p><p>I think we will be ok if they all end up in mental hospitals or dead.</p><p>Risky behavior? I would think that's the least of your concerns when your mixing uppers and downers. I feel like we might see the effects of those nasty drinks in studies done years from now on my peers that party hard. Eating a healthy diet, exercise and proper breathing also gives you energy...all day long!</p><p>Huh....I would think the mix would leave you with one heck of a hang over. The kind that feels like a spike in your brain.</p><p>@ Poppy: diaf pls. k, thnx</p><p>@ the rest of you: Chill out. You all are like watching people run around in circles pulling their hair out in a mad panic. omg omg this is hooooorible. We must lemming march and listen to these wise souls who tell us their correlational study is the gospel truth!</p><p>Alcohol has been a source of risky behavior since the dawn of, well, liquor. I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.</p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, ""This isn't news!"" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember ""everything in moderation"", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?</p><p>""Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them. Woolsey says many of these so called energy drinks contain unregulated herbal stimulants.""</p><p>Did all of you totally miss this part? You all keep going on about the caffeine. Read a story in its entirety, dont lock on one thing and run with it like a 5 year old.</p><p>More junk ""science"" used to create sensational headlines.</p><p>College kids do crazy stuff, they always have and always will. Unfortunately some of us will not live through it.</p><p>There seems to be a lot of people in denial here.</p><p>As somebody who has had a red bull/vodka combination – there is a lot of truth to this study. It truly makes you feel sober when you are digustingly NOT.</p><p>Kudos to Ok State and Mizzou for trying to educate people –too bad that it's fallen on deaf ears.",3,3,3,3

This study has no control for the initial propensity for risk that the individuals natrually possess. It certainly doesn't make me more inclined to take any risks. What it does do for me is allow me to keep up with my non-parent friends who can stay up dancing until 5am. Otherwise, I'd pass out at 11pm (toddlers really make you tired, no need to make a study for that). I don't over-do it. Those who do would overdo it and take risks no matter what they were drinking.</p><p>@johnna: that's absurd. If there is any truth to your post, then your brother most likely died because he had a congenital heart defect that may have been exacerbated by the caffeine and/or sugar in the energy drink.</p><p>Glad to know that I only consumed a small qty of jagerbombs in my life – and never more than 1 in a single night. I no longer drink any sort of energy drink, they are just bad news all around.</p><p>So.... Vodka and Red Bull is bad, but an Irish Coffee is okay? Huh.</p><p>You need the alcohol mixers in order to drink the red bull – that stuff is just nasty – battery acid tasting. ""An acquired taste."" Sorry, no thanks.</p><p>Moderation is key. Binge drinking is just plain stupid. When you have college students who think they will live forever, try to drink a keg themselves, or a liter of Jack Daniels at one sitting or ... your self-prescribed alcohol mix here ... then you will have problems.</p><p>Yes, first time binge drinkers can die. Yes, some alcoholic drinkers can drink all they way all the time and nothing ""serious"" happens to them, yet others imitating them can die. George Burns drank and smoke cigars til he died. Thousands of others imitating his kind of lifestyle died much sooner. We may never know what kept him from having problems.</p><p>I don't drink, but if I did, I'd have an XS Energy Drink and some good vodka. 14 flavors, little caffiene (6 oz coffee amt) but 5000% Vitamin B12. Yes, it could make a more awake drunk. But you could also drink the XS Energy without the booze and not have a sugar crash later. Because it doesn't have any sugar or carbs in it. Only 8 calories a can. And no acquired taste for battery acid required. www . jve . biz pwd: nutrition</p><p>Most of these posts scare me to death for today's generation. I hope there aren't many out there like you.</p><p>My preference is Tequila Bombs or Watermelon Crawls....a shot of tequila surrounded by the energy drink or 1/2 shot tequila and 1/2 shot watermelon pucker surrounded by energy drink. I usually drink about 12 of these on a ""party"" night. Feel real good all night and never feel sick the next day if I stop at 12. Anything after 12 can take a turn for the worse!</p><p>This is news? 30 years ago, it was caffiene tablets from the back of High Times and power drinking. 20 years ago, it was speed and power drinking. 10 years ago, energy drinks came on the scene and power drinkers have made the transition official. Now we have a study that advises if you give caffiene or other herbal stimulants to a power-drinker, then you get a wide-awake drunk. I wonder once again how much tax money was spent to tell me what I already knew. Does a Wide-Awake drunk engage in more risky behavior? DUH.... Is there a likelihood of Alcohol poisoning and even death in these situations? again, DUH.... The more things change, the more they remain the same.</p><p>What a ridiculous study. It's sad that people even consider this news. There is more caffeine in headache medicine than in a Red Bull. I agree that some of the larger energy drinks, like Monster and Rockstar have quite a bit of caffeine....but mixing it with alcohol isn't the problem. It's the alcohol! People have been mixing liquor with coca cola and coffee forever and this is no different.</p><p>Caffeine and alcohol? Who would have *ever* thought of mixing those two?</p><p>Anyone ever heard of ""Rum & Coke"" before?</p><p>And to the people who are equating mixing alcohol and energy drinks to cocaine, wow, you could not be more wrong. It is not even close to the same thing. Not even a little bit.</p><p>Hopefully they people get anxiety and depression and kill themselves before they cost all of money in the free health care they will require and get! Let's all be idiots and then make everyone else pay the price.</p><p>BRILLIANT!!!! Kids that are 25 and younger in this country are absolutely useless anyway. Hopefully they wipe themselves out and we jump right to next generation. Afterall, it is the same people that have worshiped Britany Spears, Paris Hilton, The Hills, and energy drinks.</p><p>I think we will be ok if they all end up in mental hospitals or dead.</p><p>Risky behavior? I would think that's the least of your concerns when your mixing uppers and downers. I feel like we might see the effects of those nasty drinks in studies done years from now on my peers that party hard. Eating a healthy diet, exercise and proper breathing also gives you energy...all day long!</p><p>Huh....I would think the mix would leave you with one heck of a hang over. The kind that feels like a spike in your brain.</p><p>@ Poppy: diaf pls. k, thnx</p><p>@ the rest of you: Chill out. You all are like watching people run around in circles pulling their hair out in a mad panic. omg omg this is hooooorible. We must lemming march and listen to these wise souls who tell us their correlational study is the gospel truth!</p><p>Alcohol has been a source of risky behavior since the dawn of, well, liquor. I don't think adding a Red Bull or a Monster is going to make that any less true.</p><p>I really get annoyed when people leave comments just to say, ""This isn't news!"" People need to be reminded once in a while if something isn't a good idea. A lot of people mix energy drinks with alcohol. As for myself, usually consume my energy drink an hour or so before beginning a night out to shake off a mood, a feeling of sloth. So maybe my timing is OK? I haven't noticed anything too unusual when I do this. It is wise to remember ""everything in moderation"", as someone above said. It is common sense, but how many of of really practice that?</p><p>""Woolsey says the danger isn't specifically in the caffeine; it's in the combination of drinks with the other stimulants potentially being more dangerous because people haven't built up tolerances to them. Woolsey says many of these so called energy drinks contain unregulated herbal stimulants.""</p><p>Did all of you totally miss this part? You all keep going on about the caffeine. Read a story in its entirety, dont lock on one thing and run with it like a 5 year old.</p><p>More junk ""science"" used to create sensational headlines.</p><p>College kids do crazy stuff, they always have and always will. Unfortunately some of us will not live through it.</p><p>There seems to be a lot of people in denial here.</p><p>As somebody who has had a red bull/vodka combination – there is a lot of truth to this study.

The in the law enforcement has an -- and perhaps --,Where did the word 'Taser' come from? A century-old racist science fiction novel,"Most people, asked to identify the most universal shift in law enforcement over the past 15 years, would likely think of militarization, calls for community policing, or perhaps the slow decline of ""broken windows"".</p><p>But from the turn of the millennium to date, arguably no development has been more widespread in law enforcement than the adoption of so called ""less-lethal"" electric control devices (ECD), which many people know by the name of their most prolific manufacturer: Taser International. The company currently supplies their weapons to 17,800 of the United States' roughly 18,000 law enforcement agencies.</p><p>The brand name Taser has become as synonymous with these devices as Kleenex or Xerox have to photocopies and tissues – a quirk of language known as a ""proprietary eponym"". The word has even become a verb, as people commonly speak of being ""Tased"" or ""Tasered"".</p><p>The word Taser, though, didn't start with the company: it's actually a loose acronym of the book Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle. Jack Cover, the inventor of the modern ECD, named his prototype after the YA sci-fi novel he loved, and the very idea for a less-lethal electric gun was largely inspired by the fictional one described in the book.</p><p>And while this quirky history is known among some in law enforcement and engineering circles, the innocence with which it's told – a curious inventor culling inspiration from the literature of his youth – belies a more sinister truth: the book itself is boldly racist.</p><p>Tom Swift and His Electric Rifle, published in New York in 1911 under the pen name Victor Appleton, is typical of the literature of its time: an imperialist adventure tale set against the backdrop of a wild and dark African continent. In it, the protagonist, Tom Swift, develops an electric rifle – a totally novel idea in 1911 – and decides to test it in Africa in the hunt for ivory.</p><p>Africa, in the context of the book, exists only as a frontier of underexploited resources ripe for the wealth accumulation of white men daring enough to attempt. ""Elephant shooting in Africa! My! With my new electric rifle ... what a fellow couldn't do in the dark continent!""</p><p>""With the price of ivory soaring,"" says Swift's veteran hunting companion, ""there's a chance for us all to get a lot of money.""</p><p>While this unabashed entrepreneurial imperialism tends to read as a relic of a bygone age, today disproportionately white police departments in places like Ferguson, Missouri, often function similarly as the adventurers sent to do the dangerous work of this kind of wealth generation. Like in the book, black communities are often seen not as dynamic places where people live lives, but as sites for plunder.</p><p>Take, for example, the Department of Justice's March report on the prevalence of predatory, revenue-based policing in St Louis County: entire municipalities there, as elsewhere in the US, float their operating budgets and justify their own existence on the racially biased extraction of statutory fees from primarily black residents. This scheme has only begun to decline because of the protests and organizing that defined Ferguson in the wake of Mike Brown's death.</p><p>In the book, as in America today, the black people are rendered as either passive, simple and childlike, or animalistic and capable of unimaginable violence. They are described in the book at various points as ""hideous in their savagery, wearing only the loin cloth, and with their kinky hair stuck full of sticks"", and as ""wild, savage and ferocious ... like little red apes"".</p><p>Swift and his travel companions quickly determine the blacks, scarcely human, need to be controlled, guided or killed as determined by the more ""civilized"" white outsiders.</p><p>Consider then how quickly the black people of Ferguson were rendered something less than fully human in the wake of Mike Brown's killing: an on-duty Ferguson police officer, a former NYPD commissioner and a popular actor all spared no time in invoking the discourse of ""animals"" in reference to black protesters. Near and far, incredulous commentators sought to cast the police as the sole defenders of black communities, and the only thing standing between those communities and self-destruction.</p><p>""White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other,"" former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani said on Meet the Press last November. Echoing Swift's rank paternalism, he later added: ""I probably saved more black lives as mayor of New York City than any mayor in the history of this city.""</p><p>In the book, when Swift and his companions proudly use their advanced weapons – particularly the electric rifle – to dispatch with an incoming buffalo stampede, they too happily celebrate themselves as saviors.</p><p>""Had it not been for the white men, the native village, which consisted of only frail huts, would have been completely wiped out by the animals,"" the novel reads.</p><p>Being named after a racist book doesn't make a company or device racist, any more than a person being named after a racist relative makes them so. A name is just that – and a Taser on its face is no more racist than the city or state of Washington are, simply for being named after our slaveholding first president.</p><p>But as recent campus activism in places such as Harvard and Princeton have demonstrated, there is real value in coming to terms with the bigotry embedded in the seemingly innocuous names and symbols of even our most ordinary, and aspirationally colorblind, institutions.</p><p>Being aware of the history of the word Taser should make us pause and consider that, every day, predominantly white police officers walk into predominantly black communities armed with weapons first imagined in a book in which ""civilized"" whites entered the black wilds for the purpose of plunder, only to cast themselves as the saviors of the natives. It isn't meaningless that today that sequence sometimes appears to persist in reverse.",1,1,1,1

"John Avlon voter turnout in the is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file , a bad omen for the GOP .",Why has GOP turnout taken a dive?,"A worker sets up a polling station the morning of the GOP primary in Florida. Fewer voters than expected turned out.</p><p>Editor's note: John Avlon is a CNN contributor and senior political columnist for Newsweek and The Daily Beast. He is co-editor of the book ""Deadline Artists: America's Greatest Newspaper Columns.""</p><p>(CNN) -- Beneath Rick Santorum's stunning three-state sweep on Tuesday stands another stubborn sign of dissatisfaction with the status quo: Republican turnout is down.</p><p>I'm talking embarrassingly, disturbingly, hey-don't-you-know-it's-an-election-year bad. It is a sign of a serious enthusiasm gap among the rank and file, and a particularly bad omen for Mitt Romney and the GOP in the general election.</p><p>Here's the tale of the tape, state by state, beginning with Tuesday night: Minnesota had just more than 47,000 people turn out for its caucuses this year -- four years ago it was nearly 63,000 -- and Romney came in first, not a distant third as he did Tuesday night. In Colorado, more than 70,000 people turned out for its caucus in 2008 -- but in 2012 it was 65,000. And Missouri -- even making a generous discount for the fact that this was an entirely symbolic contest -- had 232,000 people turn out, less than half the number who did four years ago.</p><p>Even with months of pre-primary hype and attention solely devoted to the Republican field, turnout in this election cycle essentially flat-lined. In Iowa, a little more than 121,000 people voted, compared with nearly 119,000 four years before, when action in the Democratic caucuses absorbed most of the attention.</p><p>In New Hampshire, the same dynamic applied -- 245,000 voters turned out in 2012, compared with 241,000 four years before, despite Republicans being the only game in town and independents making up 47% of the total turnout in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Take out the independent voters and you've got a deep net decline.</p><p>Always proudly rebellious, South Carolina has been the great outlier in this election cycle. With Newt Gingrich making an all-out push for conservatives in a conservative state, turnout was up almost 150,000 over four years before.</p><p>But in Florida, the decline became unmistakable. Maybe it decreased because the Romney and Gingrich campaigns, plus super PACS, spent more than $18 million in the Sunshine State on TV ads, of which 93% were negative in the last week alone, according to the Campaign Media Analysis Group. After all, negative ads depress turnout. But after all the mud was thrown, 1.6 million people turned out in the nation's fourth largest state, which might sound impressive until you compare it with the nearly 2 million who turned out in 2008.</p><p>Nevada was even worse, with 32,894 people turning out to vote in a state with more than 465,000 registered Republicans. Four years before, more than 44,300 participated in the caucus. Turnout was down more than 25% despite the GOP caucuses being the only game in town. Party officials were expecting a turnout of more than 70,000.</p><p>All this should be a wake-up call for the GOP. Despite an enormous amount of national media attention devoted to each of the states to date, the response has been a notable yawn among the Republican rank and file.</p><p>The turnout numbers are even worse when you compare them with the number of registered Republicans in each state that has voted to date.</p><p>The caucuses in particular bring out an unrepresentative sample of a state's Republican Party. For all the grass-roots romanticism, there has got to be a better way to pick a presidential nominee.</p><p>But the news is worst for Romney, long the presumptive front-runner in a party that tends to reward the man next in line.</p><p>""Reluctantly Romney"" could be a bumper sticker, even for his supporters. The former Massachusetts governor has found it difficult to climb above 35% in national polls, meaning that a majority of Republicans still support someone else in a notably weak field. His vote margins and totals lag behind those of four years before, when he lost the nomination to John McCain in a crowded and comparatively competent field, although Minnesota is the first state he won in '08 and lost in 2012.</p><p>You reap what you sow, and part of the reason turnout is down is directly related to the problem of polarization. The Republican Party is more ideologically polarized than at any time in recent history. Therefore, it put up more purely right-wing candidates than it did four years before, when center-right leaders such as McCain and Rudy Giuliani were also in the race. A bigger tent inspired bigger turnout.</p><p>But the other reason is simple dissatisfaction with the candidates.</p><p>Republicans seem united in their anger against the president -- like the Democrats in 2004 -- but they are uninspired by their options. Draft movements for fantasy candidates ranging from Chris Christie to Mitch Daniels to Paul Ryan and even Jeb Bush have started and failed. Some party leaders show more enthusiasm for a hypothetical 2016 crop of candidates, including Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, than they do for the flawed choices before them in this election. Divided and dispirited is an odd place for the Republican Party to be so soon after the enthusiasms of the 2010 tea party-driven election.</p><p>The bottom line is that voter turnout matters. And what should be most troubling for Republicans is that this enthusiasm gap among the conservative base is accompanied by a lack of candidates who might appeal to independents and centrist swing voters in the general election. It is a double barrel of bad news for the Republican Party. The numbers can be spun and rationalized by professional partisan operatives all day long, but the fact remains -- voters just aren't turning out to cast their votes for this crop of conservative candidates in 2012.</p><p>Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.</p><p>Join the conversation on Facebook.</p><p>The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.",3,3,3,3

But good luck into the front seat .",First Look: BMW i8,"By DEXTER FORDMAY 9, 2014</p><p>MALIBU, CALIF. — Good luck, America, with your efforts to pigeonhole the BMW i8.</p><p>The car is a post-petroleum brand statement. It's a sci-fi showpiece. It's an ultralight carbon-fiber production car. It's a triumph of parts-bin engineering. It's a take-no-prisoners canyon racer. It's a winged chariot of the Malibu über-chic. It's a $136,625 (destination included!) commuter car for Silicon Valley moguls.</p><p>The hardware, at least, is straightforward. The central passenger shell is a stiff, lightweight carbon-fiber structure. It is bolted to an aluminum skeleton that holds the 7.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack in its spine.</p><p>An electric drive section similar to the one in the BMW i3 people pod is bolted to the front, its 131 horsepower electric motor and 2-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The rear power package is sourced from the new Mini; its 3-cylinder, twin-turbocharged 231-horsepower engine drives the rear wheels through a 6-speed automatic transmission.</p><p>The multilayered skin is molded thermoplastic that weighs half as much as steel.

The Victoria Hotel within the Playa Dorado golf resort here plans to begin offering a fractional ownership club this year.</p><p>• Cabarete. Less developed than Puerto Plata, beach-centric Cabarete has until recently attracted mainly European buyers. That is about to change with the transformation of the Playa Grande golf course — known as ""the Pebble Beach of the Caribbean"" — into a high-end residential community. It will include an equestrian center, clubhouse and recreational facilities, with villas and estate houses on sale later this year. Luxury Asian developer Aman is also planning a private enclave of residential villas here.</p><p>• Samana Peninsula. Several towns on this 40-mile-long peninsula are seeing development, but for U.S. buyers, the runaway favorite is Las Terrenas. Already home to several boutique hotels, the longtime fishing village is emerging as a culinary hotspot, with European chefs taking advantage of the seafood. A 66-acre former coconut plantation, Las Terrenas' Balcones del Atlantico will have 350 residences, from apartments to beach villas, from $475,000 to $1.7 million. The second of three phases, which includes a hotel from RockResorts, opens this summer.</p><p>You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

First case of long - term remission scientists the of early HIV and treatment,Teenager infected with HIV before birth healthy after 12 years without treatment,"A French teenager who was infected with HIV as a baby and given intensive drug therapy in early childhood has lived for more than 12 years without any treatment, raising hopes among scientists searching for a cure for Aids.</p><p>The case of the 18-year-old was presented at an Aids conference in Vancouver, Canada, by doctors at the Institut Pasteur who treated her. Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.</p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a ""functional cure"", because the child had no detectable virus.</p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.</p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.</p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.</p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable – although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.</p><p>There are people known as ""elite controllers"" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier Sáez-Cirión, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. ""Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.""</p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.</p><p>Sáez-Cirión said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.</p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission</p><p>""She is doing perfectly well,"" said Sáez-Cirión. ""She has a healthy life with no complications."" But he added: ""Very clearly this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.""</p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: ""We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure … the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.""</p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.</p><p>""The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,"" she said. ""These studies are happening in Thailand at the moment. They are going to be really informative.""",3,4,4,3

Like the so-called Mississippi baby, she became infected before birth and received drug treatment in the first weeks of her life.</p><p>Both children were denied follow-up care when their parents took them out of medical treatment and did not give them the prescribed drugs. The case of the US child caused huge excitement when the infant was brought back to the University of Mississippi medical centre in Jackson. Doctors talked in terms of a ""functional cure"", because the child had no detectable virus.</p><p>However, the remission lasted only 27 months before the viral levels rose again in the child's body. HIV scientists confessed to disappointment, although they said they would learn a huge amount from the case.</p><p>This time there is more caution. It is the first case of long-term remission in a child, say the French team, but they accept that it may not be permanent.</p><p>The child was born to a woman with untreated HIV and was given a drug for six weeks after her birth to try to prevent infection, but to no avail. Two months after the prophylactic drug was stopped, tests showed the infant had a high viral load and she was put on a cocktail of three antiretroviral medicines, which is the standard treatment for HIV.</p><p>When the girl was six years old, the family decided to stop the drugs and for six months doctors did not have contact with her. But when she was brought back, tests showed she had no detectable traces of the virus in her body. Twelve years and no drugs later, it is still undetectable – although experience has shown that does not mean there is not a hidden reservoir.</p><p>There are people known as ""elite controllers"" whose immune systems appear to keep the virus at bay, but according to Dr Asier Sáez-Cirión, of the HIV, inflammation and persistence unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, the Frenchwoman does not have the genetic factors associated with those. ""Most likely she has been in virological remission for so long because she received a combination of antiretrovirals very soon after infection.""</p><p>That happened with a group of 14 adults in France, known as the Visconti cohort. They were treated with drugs soon after infection and all except two still have no detectable virus, even though they stopped taking the drugs years ago. Scientists think early treatment may limit the development of reservoirs of HIV and preserve the body's immune system defences.</p><p>Sáez-Cirión said there were 580 people in France who contracted HIV as babies, of whom about 100 were given drug treatment within the first six months of life. Of those, 15 stopped treatment, but the virus rebounded within weeks or months in 13 of them. Of the two remaining, one lasted for three years without needing drugs and the other is the young woman who has been off treatment for 12 years.</p><p>She has a healthy life with no complications, but this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission</p><p>""She is doing perfectly well,"" said Sáez-Cirión. ""She has a healthy life with no complications."" But he added: ""Very clearly this girl is not cured. We're talking about remission.""</p><p>The case was presented at the eighth International Aids Society (IAS) Conference on HIV pathogenesis, treatment and prevention. Prof Sharon Lewin, director of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said she thought it was interesting, but added: ""We really need to move beyond these anecdotal cases in our quest for a cure … the child received medication early after birth. We don't know whether she would have controlled the virus anyway without receiving the medication. About 1% of people can do that.""</p><p>Lewin, a member of the IAS Global Initiative Towards an HIV Cure, said trials were needed. It was universally recognised that people with HIV should be put on treatment as soon as possible after diagnosis. Itwas possible that some who had been treated early in their infection might be able to stop taking the drugs, but that had to be properly tested.</p><p>""The only way we can address this is in a trial where we start a group of people very early on treatment and then randomise them to stop,"" she said.

"WASHINGTON -- President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology . Over the longer term , several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews , they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran 's central bank -- a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations .",White House Says Data Shows Iran Push on Nuclear Arms,"WASHINGTON — President Obama is pressing United Nations nuclear inspectors to release classified intelligence information showing that Iran is designing and experimenting with nuclear weapons technology. The president's push is part of a larger American effort to further isolate and increase pressure on Iran after accusing it of a plot to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States.</p><p>If the United Nations' watchdog group agrees to publicize the evidence, including new data from recent months, it would almost certainly revive a debate that has been dormant during the Arab Spring about how aggressively the United States and its allies, including Israel, should move to halt Iran's suspected weapons program.</p><p>Over the longer term, several senior Obama administration officials said in interviews, they are mulling a ban on financial transactions with Iran's central bank — a move that has been opposed by China and other Asian nations. Also being considered is an expansion of the ban on the purchase of petroleum products sold by companies controlled by the country's elite military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps.</p><p>The Revolutionary Guards are also believed to oversee the military side of the nuclear program, and they are the parent of the Quds Force, which Washington has accused of directing the assassination plot.</p><p>The proposed sanctions come as administration officials confront skepticism around the world about their allegations that Iran was behind the plot and limited options about what they can do — as well as growing pressure from Republicans and some Democrats in Congress to take tougher action against Iran, with the central bank and the oil industry high on lawmakers' lists.</p><p>All of the proposed sanctions carry with them considerable political and economic risks. Yukiya Amano, the cautious director general of the United Nations group, the International Atomic Energy Agency, talked publicly in September about publishing some of the most delicate data suggesting Iran worked on nuclear triggers and warheads. But officials who have spoken with him say he is concerned that his inspectors could be ejected from Iran, shutting the best, though narrow, window into its nuclear activities.</p><p>Similarly, China and Russia, among other major Iranian trading partners, have resisted further oil and financial sanctions, saying the goal of isolating Iran is a poor strategy. Even inside the Obama administration, some officials say they fear any crackdown on Iranian oil exports could drive up oil prices when the United States and European economies are weak. As one senior official put it, ""You don't want to tip the U.S. into a downturn just to punish the Iranians.""</p><p>Senior administration officials, who would not speak publicly about internal negotiations over the sanctions, say no recommendation on acting against the central bank has gone to Mr. Obama, who vowed last week to make sure Iran would face the ""toughest sanctions"" for what he said was its role in the sensational scheme to hire a Mexican drug cartel to kill the Saudi envoy.</p><p>The decision to press the International Atomic Energy Agency was brewing even before the plot against the Saudi ambassador was discovered, but that discovery prompted the White House to pursue a full-court, public press of the agency to release the sensitive intelligence.</p><p>Officials familiar with the evidence say it creates extraordinarily uncomfortable questions for the Iranians to answer, but does not definitively point to the construction of a weapon. Instead, it details work on individual technologies essential for designing and detonating a nuclear device, including how to turn uranium into bomb fuel, how to cast conventional explosives in a shape that can set off a nuclear blast, and how to make detonators, generate neutrons to spur a chain reaction, measure detonation waves and make nose cones for missiles.</p><p>Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Saturday that ""the United States believes that a comprehensive assessment would be invaluable for the international community in its consideration of Iran's nuclear program and what to do about it."" Iran has declared that all of the documents suggesting work on how to create a weapon that could fit atop an Iranian missile are ""fabrications"" intended to justify an attack. The country has been the target of covert attacks, including the assassinations of some nuclear scientists and a computer worm that disabled some of Iran's nuclear centrifuges.</p><p>The Obama administration, since coming to office, has never publicly presented detailed evidence to back up its claim that Iran is driving toward a weapon or creating the technology to assemble one quickly, should it need it.

The Archdiocese of Miami an - popular after a pictures of him cavorting with a woman,The Father Cutie Scandal: Sex and the Single Priest,"If only it were the worst thing that a Roman Catholic priest has been caught doing. The Mexican celebrity magazine TVnotas recently published 25 paparazzi photos of the Rev. Alberto Cutié, the popular Miami Beach priest famous for his Spanish-language television and radio talk shows, cavorting amorously on a Florida beach with an attractive woman. Over a three-day period, the pictures also captured him kissing her in a bar. In one of TVnotas's ""in fragranti"" shots [Note to TVnotas copy editors: it's ""in flagrante""] the woman wraps her legs around Cutié; in another, Cutié has a hand down her swimsuit, fondling her rear end.</p><p>Because of the scandal, the Archdiocese of Miami says Cutié, 40, is no longer the administrator of his Miami Beach parish, and it has barred him from leading Sunday mass there. His media work seems up in the air now, and the popular website padrealberto.net has only a blue screen with a message from Cutié asking forgiveness. (See the 25 most influential evangelicals in America.)</p><p>Most Catholics probably don't approve of CutiÃ©'s affair. Still, will they back the archdiocese? CutiÃ©'s punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church — the ""bride of Christ."" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said CutiÃ©'s actions ""cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest."" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)</p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years — including a case involving a former priest at CutiÃ©'s South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of CutiÃ©'s tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as CutiÃ© wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)</p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of CutiÃ©'s popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, CutiÃ©'s romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest — more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of ""non-negotiable"" rules. ""He was doing this fairly out in the open,"" notes one Miami Catholic who knows CutiÃ© well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. ""Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.""</p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to CutiÃ© isn't surprising, either. CutiÃ©'s last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest ""Father Cutie"" — the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname ""Father What-a-Waste."" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is ""a struggle, but it's a good struggle.""</p><p>It was a battle that CutiÃ© was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater — especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And CutiÃ© was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cutié is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a ""blasphemous"" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cutié usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.</p><p>Nonetheless, the CutiÃ© scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be CutiÃ©'s Oprah-like standing in the Latino community — the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that CutiÃ© is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.</p><p>For his part, Cutié said in his statement that ""the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,"" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cutié's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize ""that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.""</p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, ""Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments."" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cutié for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.",2,2,2,3

CutiÃ©'s punishment is understandable at first glance, at least for his hypocrisy if not for the betrayal of his oath of celibacy. To the Catholic Church, priestly ordination means a marriage vow to the church — the ""bride of Christ."" In a statement, Miami Archbishop John Favalora said CutiÃ©'s actions ""cannot be condoned despite the good work he's done as a priest."" (See pictures of a Catholic congregation fighting to save its church building.)</p><p>But Cutie's penalty might elicit more than a few snickers from Catholics who have spent the past few decades watching the priestly perdition parade of sexual abuse, parish embezzlement and doctrinal intolerance. The Miami archdiocese has had to pay out millions of dollars in sexual-abuse settlements in recent years — including a case involving a former priest at CutiÃ©'s South Beach church, St. Francis de Sales. (One of CutiÃ©'s tasks, in fact, has been to heal the wounds inside that parish.) To his credit, Favalora is trying to restore public trust in his archdiocese and the Church. But so long as CutiÃ© wasn't frolicking with a minor (female or male) or using parish funds to buy margaritas for his paramour, many parishioners may actually be relieved that their popular priest has a libido focused on a woman who has reached the age of consent.(Check out a story about the heartthrob of the Vatican.)</p><p>What's more, one of the pillars of CutiÃ©'s popularity is his relationship counseling. To any Catholic who's had to suffer through a lecture on marriage from a celibate kid just out of seminary, CutiÃ©'s romantic romp might just make him a more appealing priest — more human, perhaps, than Catholic clergy who deny communion to divorcees, gays and anyone else who dares violate the Church's litany of ""non-negotiable"" rules. ""He was doing this fairly out in the open,"" notes one Miami Catholic who knows CutiÃ© well and has undergone marriage counseling with him. ""Most priests who do this usually try to hide it, but this wasn't some dirty little tryst in the back of the parish residence. It doesn't appear to be just about sex; it's about intimacy, and he's always been able to help people understand which is more important.""</p><p>The attraction of the unidentified woman in the photos to CutiÃ© isn't surprising, either. CutiÃ©'s last name is pronounced koo-tee-AY, but that hasn't stopped people from calling the handsome, telegenic priest ""Father Cutie"" — the kind of hunk-in-a-collar whom smitten Catholic schoolgirls often nickname ""Father What-a-Waste."" In 1999, when he burst onto the scene just four years after his ordination with his first television talk show on the Spanish-language Telemundo network, Cambia Tu Vida Con Padre Alberto (Change Your Life With Father Alberto), he remarked to the Miami Herald that celibacy is ""a struggle, but it's a good struggle.""</p><p>It was a battle that CutiÃ© was perhaps destined to lose, not just because of his good looks but his celebrity. In the chaste, pre-Vatican II culture of the 1950s, no one would have dared wonder if a priestly TV phenom like Bishop Fulton Sheen had a girlfriend. But today, the temptations for an attractive media star, ordained or not, are greater — especially in the narcissistic Gomorrah of South Beach. And CutiÃ© was never a shy altar boy to begin with. Born in Puerto Rico to Cuban parents, he was a popular deejay as a teen, and he still likes disco music and getting buff in the gym.</p><p>That's not to say, however, that Cutié is a liberal priest. His current television talk show, Hablando Con Padre Alberto (Talking With Father Alberto), is aired on the conservative Catholic network EWTN (Eternal World Television Network) founded by the engaging but dogmatically stern nun, Mother Angelica. Last December he blasted Playboy's Mexican edition for what he called a ""blasphemous"" cover photo that depicted a model as the Virgin Mary. On his shows on the Radio Paz (Radio Peace) network, and in his columns and books, such as Ama de Verdad, Vive de Verdad (Real Love, Real Life), Cutié usually toes the Vatican's doctrinal line on issues like abortion.</p><p>Nonetheless, the CutiÃ© scandal is sure to ratchet up debate over clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church, a spiritual ideal that seems to collide more often today with biological reality. (See the recent paternity-suit travails of Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo, who has admitted to fathering a child, and is alleged to have sired others, while he was still a priest.) A bigger problem for the Church, however, may be CutiÃ©'s Oprah-like standing in the Latino community — the only demographic where U.S. Catholicism is experiencing growth. America's Catholic bishops, many of whom are widely accused of allowing the sexual abuse crisis to happen, must realize that CutiÃ© is more well regarded among Catholics than they are, especially among Latinos, meaning the hierarchy will probably need to handle the tele-priest's future with special care.</p><p>For his part, Cutié said in his statement that ""the commitment I made to serve God will remain intact,"" a vague message that left many of his parishioners wondering if he plans to stay in the priesthood. Regardless, Cutié's Miami Catholic friend notes that the priest, and the Church, need to recognize ""that there's another human being involved in this, the woman in the pictures, and if they're not sensitive to her as well they're looking at double the scandal.""</p><p>In his statement, Favalora said, ""Scandals such as this offer an occasion for the Church on all levels to examine our consciences regarding the integrity of our commitments."" He's right; but scandals like this also prompt Catholics to more closely and critically examine the battered integrity of their Church. And while they may not applaud Cutié for tasting forbidden fruit, they may not condemn him as harshly as the Church thinks they should either.",3,3,3,3

"Web series are , The Good Wife is - snubbed , The is snubbed and it 's for The Affair and Jane the Virgin",What the Golden Globes 2015 nominations say about TV right now,"For the first time in Golden Globes history, not one of the traditional big four networks – NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX – received a nomination for best comedy or musical series. Even that reliable hoover-upper of awards, Modern Family, failed to make the list, with the nods going instead to the relatively young network addition The CW (Jane the Virgin), HBO (Silicon Valley, Girls) and web-based shows (Orange Is The New Black, Transparent). It tells us a lot about both the remarkable rise of the internet upstarts – Amazon, nominated with Transparent, only released their first original series in 2013 – and also the demise of the once-redoubtable network sitcom. And, given the quality of many of the fall additions – Mulaney, Bad Judge – it's a situation that might not change any time soon.‬</p><p>The outstanding Showtime drama, which stars Ruth Wilson and Dominic West as the participants in the titular affair, both telling their side of the story as they saw it, hasn't been a ratings smash, though figures have been rising as the first season progresses. The nods for Wilson, West and the big one, best drama series (where it is the only debut season to compete) are a vote of confidence for its sheer quality – it's a grownup, sophisticated drama that deserves the love, much like Masters of Sex last time.</p><p>This hasn't been a solid show since its first season, and yet somehow it's nominated for best drama series again, alongside the vastly superior Game of Thrones, The Good Wife, The Affair and House of Cards. Sorry about that, America. And while we're at it: Ricky Gervais for Derek? Sorry about that, too.</p><p>There was much discussion around last year's Emmys and a perceived Good Wife ""snub"", when the truly brilliant fifth season failed to get a best drama series nod (though Julianna Margulies did eventually walk away with a best actress award). At the Golden Globes, The Good Wife is emphatically included: best drama, best actress for Margulies and a much-deserved best supporting actor for Alan Cumming. Of course Christine Baranski should have been up for best supporting actress and Josh Charles best actor, but you can't win 'em all.</p><p>For the fourth year in a row, TV's most-watched show has been ignored by voters: 2010 remains the only year it was in the running for best drama series. That wouldn't have been an issue when the show was a shuffling, brainless mess, as it has been in previous seasons, but the most recent has been picking up critical plaudits as well as viewers' eyeballs. Its absence leaves the Globes open to accusations of snobbery.</p><p>This CW show, which tells the story of a religious young woman who is accidentally inseminated, pays homage to the telenovela format and comes off as original, heartfelt and surprisingly charming. It's this year's true underdog, picking up nominations for best comedy and best comedy actress for lead Gina Rodriguez.</p><p>A quick glance at the full list of nominations shows just how A-list and Hollywood TV has become: Maggie Gyllenhaal, Clive Owen, Viola Davis, Kevin Spacey, Frances McDormand, Matthew McConaughey, Billy Bob Thornton, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Kathy Bates, Jon Voight and Bill Murray have all been either Academy Award winners or nominees. The small screen has gone huge.</p><p>Masters of Sex, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family all received multiple nominations last year, but were snubbed this time around. None did anything terribly wrong – Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Big Bang Theory are the same as they ever were, and Masters of Sex and Modern Family have arguably improved in the most recent series. Instead it seems like a clutch of newer, shinier, and more talked-about shows, such as The Affair and Transparent have captured voters' imaginations.",2,3,2,2

It's a ready-made animal house, with rules laid down by a briefly seen coach (Jonathan Breck) that are immediately ignored. Occasionally we'll get an onscreen reminder of how many dwindling days and hours remain before classes begin. These, too, are ignored.</p><p>Instead, Linklater parks his cameras to observe, with indulgence and much good humor, the bonding rituals of young men who only think they have it figured out. Jake's housemates fall into general categories that re-sort themselves into individual personalities: The motor-mouthed ladies' man Finnegan (Glen Powell), the Zen surfer-stoner Willoughby (Wyatt Russell), uber-competitive McReynolds (Tyler Hoechlin), country rube Billy (Will Brittain), smartass Nesbit (Austin Amelio), naïve Brumley (Tanner Kalina).

Searching for good times and girls, they hop from a disco one night to a country and western bar the next to a punk mosh pit to an art-student costume party, minds open, adapting, ever-changing.

She's unpretentious for a theater brat, he's smart and soulful for a jock, and the two stand dazzled in the Venn diagram overlap of their attraction. These scenes try a little too hard to be charming but they are anyway, and if Deutch has the freckles and immediacy of a classic Brat Pack heroine, it may be because her mother is Lea Thompson of ""Back to the Future"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" and her father is Howard Deutch, who directed the latter.</p><p>More second-generation pleasures: Wyatt Russell, who plays the woolly baseball mystic Willoughby, is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn, and he has a high old time — emphasis on high — explaining to his teammates why ""Fearless,"" from the 1971 album ""Meddle,"" is the best track that Pink Floyd ever recorded. Because he is correct, I am awarding ""Everybody Wants Some!!"" an extra half-star.</p><p>Linklater was a high school baseball player who went to Sam Houston State on a scholarship, and the movie is steeped in the lazy, rivalrous minutiae of college ball. Willoughby gets off a moment of bliss when he muses on the pleasures of pitching — ""It's lovely out there on the bump,"" he says — and we learn that it's the .230 hitters who are always the most superstitious. Also that it's possible to slice a pitched baseball in half with an ax.

His brother, Larry Pratcher Jr., was ejected from the court room after issuing a string of obscenities.</p><p>Kelly's family nodded and clapped, and the victim's father, Landrin Kelly, hugged his wife.</p><p>Muriel Pratcher, Pratcher's mother, cried when the verdict was announced, saying, ""Oh my God.""</p><p>""It was a no-win situation,"" Bernice Moore, Pratcher's grandmother, said outside the courtroom. ""I lost my grandson to prison, Mr. Kelly lost his son forever. We both lost. It's just a tragedy.""</p><p>During the trial, Pratcher's own attorney admitted that the young man fired the four rifle shots that killed Kelly on Aug. 12, 2004 -- two days before the football player was scheduled to move to the University of Oregon on a sports scholarship.</p><p>But defense attorney Jonathan Laba argued that Pratcher killed Kelly in a case of mistaken identity. He said that the defendant feared for his life in an unrelated dispute and accidentally shot Kelly as the football player was waiting in a car to give his stepbrother, Brandon Young, a ride home from his girlfriend's house in Richmond's Iron Triangle District.</p><p>Laba argued that Pratcher should be convicted of manslaughter because the death was ""a tragic mistake.""</p><p>But prosecutor David Brown told jurors Kelly's death amounted to ""cold-blooded murder,"" because Pratcher was determined to kill someone that night. Brown argued that Pratcher had the opportunity to notice that Kelly was in the car before grabbing the rifle, advancing on the Oldsmobile and opening fire.</p><p>""It's totally unfair for them to say it was premeditated,"" said Pratcher's father, Larry Sr. ""Terrance just came right up; it's impossible for it to be premeditated. It's totally unfair -- my son is not guilty of first degree murder.""</p><p>Pratcher was 15 years old when Kelly was killed and was tried as an adult in Contra Costa County Superior Court. He faces and faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life.</p><p>Kelly died two days before he was to leave for the University of Oregon, where he had a football scholarship and was expected top play safety. His death stunned his hometown of Richmond as well as students, former players and fans at De La Salle in Concord.</p><p>Kelly had been named the most valuable player the previous season at De La Salle, where he played linebacker and running back on a team that didn't lose a game in his four years there.</p><p>Police arrested Pratcher, whose older brother, Larry Jr., had played youth basketball with Kelly, five days after the killing. Several witnesses placed Pratcher at the crime scene with the rifle, and at least two told investigators they saw him fire into Kelly's car.</p><p>Brown offered no motive for the crime but said Pratcher told a friend: ""I had to do what I had to do.""",4,4,4,4

on -- Limbaugh 's people are saying that ?,"On Fox News, Limbaugh lawyer says, 'You can't maliciously attack people'","Los Angeles-based lawyer Patricia Glaser appeared on Fox News's ""Hannity"" last night to advance Rush Limbaugh's case against the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee over the radio host's comments about sexual consent in a Sept. 15 broadcast. ""You can't maliciously attack people, their freedom of speech,"" Glaser told Sean Hannity. ""And you certainly can't put words — and it's irresponsible to put words in the mouth of someone that were never uttered.""</p><p>With that attack, Glaser summed up a Nov. 6 threat letter that she sent to the DCCC on Limbaugh's behalf. At issue in the spat is a Sept. 17 e-mail blast from the DCCC accusing Limbaugh of ""excusing rape on college campuses"" and saying ""'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it."" The way Limbaugh & Co. see things, that's an out-of-context slam on the radio host, who said all of this:</p><p>How many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that 'no' means 'yes' if you know how to spot it? I'm probably — let me tell you something, in this modern world, that is simply, that's not tolerated. People aren't even going to try to understand that one. I mean, it used to be said as a cliche. Used to be part of the advice young boys were given. See, that's what we've got to change. We have got to reprogram the way we raise men. Permission every step of the way, clearly spelling out 'why.' Are these not lawsuits waiting to happen if even one of these steps is not taken?</p><p>Responding to a question from Hannity about Limbaugh's status as a public figure for the purposes of media law, Glaser noted, ""What do I have to demonstrate because he's a public figure? I have to show malice. Could it be any clearer what the malice is? I don't even think I need to explain that to people who are watching the show. It is a deliberate effort to mischaracterize,"" she said. As the Erik Wemple Blog pointed out yesterday, the DCCC had plenty of company in its interpretation of Limbaugh's remarks.</p><p>Though Glaser knows the legal issues surrounding Limbaugh's claims, she earns no self-awareness points. By saying ""You can't maliciously attack people,"" Glaser invites comparison with Limbaugh's 2012 offensive against Sandra Fluke, then a Georgetown University law student who had given testimony on Capitol Hill on the importance of contraception coverage in insurance plans. Limbaugh proceeded to hammer her for being a ""slut,"" a ""prostitute"" and many other things.</p><p>The Washington Post's Gene Weingarten wrote about Limbaugh's fine appreciation of context in the Fluke case:</p><p>All of this bile followed from his assertion that she testified about her own extremely active sex life.</p><p>Here's the thing: She didn't. She said nothing whatsoever about her own sex life. She did not mention her own contraceptive needs at all: She spoke passionately and eloquently, and respectfully, about several friends of hers, Georgetown students who she said were diagnosed with medical conditions requiring the birth control pill, but who could not get it because they could not afford it. That was it. Here is the transcript of her testimony.</p><p>Following a huge uproar, Limbaugh apologized to Fluke for his ""word choices.""</p><p>Limbaugh & Co., said Glaser, wants the DCCC to make amends: ""We want an apology. We want a retraction. And we want it as broadly disseminated as the irresponsible defamation was broadly disseminated,"" she told Hannity.</p><p>As for the Fox News host, he sounded excited about a legal proceeding: ""You know what, it's a serious issue, because I think you're right,"" Hannity said. ""And as somebody that works in this business, this happens all the time. And in this case I believe they so crossed the line. It's going to be very interesting to see this work its way through the courts. I think they're going to be surprised.""</p><p>Erik Wemple writes the Erik Wemple blog, where he reports and opines on media organizations of all sorts.",2,2,2,2

It's been nearly two decades since pictures of this sort were produced with any regularity by the studio system, and a lot longer since they were stateside successes. Many of the attempts in recent years have been, at best, mid-budget passion projects with circumscribed audiences (Stallone's own</p><p>which topped out at $42 million domestically) or post-modern winks (the French-language ""JCVD"" from 2008, a hostage movie in which Jean-Claude Van Damme plays a version of himself). The few large-scale attempts, like ""The A-Team,"" underperformed. (The biceps-and-bullets remake grossed $77 million domestically, a number that will likely be easily surpassed by ""The Expendables."")</p><p>But the Stallone picture -- with its hard-charging, take-no-prisoners patriotism unbothered by the vagaries of the real world (it takes place in a fictional country, for starters) and its caricature of freedom-hating enemies (""We will kill this American disease,"" as the TV spot enticed us) -- planted itself squarely in the old-school genre. And this weekend, the movie showed that there's life in that category yet. That ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" the tongue-in-cheek, pop-culture-referential, decidedly 2010 creation -- the one for, of and by arch fanboys -- trailed well behind ""The Expendables"" only drove home the point more loudly.</p><p>On one hand, it's understandable that a movie of easy American heroism (OK, first-world Western heroism) would catch on. In fact, it's surprising it didn't happen sooner. Apple-pie-patriotism already is behind the success of a cable news network and supports large sections of the contemporary country music industry. Why not a film hit too?</p><p>But among all the factors to which one might point in explaining the success of ""The Expendables"" -- a cast harvested from so many demographics and eras; a moviegoer backlash to 3-D and CG effects -- it somehow doesn't feel that the demand for neat heroes and villains is one of them.</p><p>Norris and his ilk would submit that in our current period of ideological and geopolitical upheaval, in a time of blurry lines between enemies and friends in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, that black-and-white heroes slake a patriotic thirst (and that, indeed, the movie-going world can support a lot more of them). But history argues the opposite: Those movies succeed when the culture at large is filled with clear-cut distinctions. On the other hand, when the zeitgeist is more cloudy, an entirely different kind of cinema prospers.</p><p>The post-WWII era and its mainly straightforward distinctions between good and evil, to take an example of the former, yielded a flowering subgenre of movies with morally uncomplicated gunslingers. And 30 years later, the ideological simplicity of the Cold War and its larger-than-life Evil Empire gave rise to the very action movies on which ""Expendables"" is modeled (not to mention the ultimate in us-versus-them confections, ""Rocky IV."" Yes, there's a Stallone-ishness to all of this). There are plenty of reasons why these types of movies faded from view in the 1990s, but the fall of the Berlin Wall and the the Soviet Union certainly played a part.</p><p>The examples are just as abundant on the other side. The ambiguities of the Vietnam War and the counterculture in the late 1960s and early 1970s undoubtedly offered up the moral murkiness of</p><p>""Midnight Cowboy"" and scores of others. In the post-9/11 world, meanwhile, movies like</p><p>-- with its themes of a destruction-bent enemy that can't be bargained with, and the question of what constitutes an acceptable ethical compromise in fighting that enemy -- have captured our imagination. You can throw</p><p>in there too, to the degree the movie was a contemplation of Western interests in the Middle East.</p><p>Political eras are, of course, rarely just one thing or another, and the movies we want to see in a given period are hardly monolithic. But as tempting as it is to infer that the success of ""The Expendables"" shows a deeper cultural need, it may well be the wrong inference. When times are confusing, we want movies to reflect that confusion, and even to make sense of it. But we probably don't want to pretend that confusion doesn't exist.</p><p>Photo: A scene from ""The Expendables.""

A study of women in India has found that a simple test vinegar could save thousands of lives a year by spotting early signs of cervical cancer .,"Vinegar cancer test saves lives, India study finds","MUMBAI, India – A simple vinegar test slashed cervical cancer death rates by one-third in a remarkable study of 150,000 women in the slums of India, where the disease is the top cancer killer of women.</p><p>Doctors reported the results Sunday at a cancer conference in Chicago. Experts called the outcome ""amazing"" and said this quick, cheap test could save tens of thousands of lives each year in developing countries by spotting early signs of cancer, allowing treatment before it's too late.</p><p>Usha Devi, one of the women in the study, says it saved her life.</p><p>""Many women refused to get screened. Some of them died of cancer later,"" Devi said. ""Now I feel everyone should get tested. I got my life back because of these tests.""</p><p>Pap smears and tests for HPV, a virus that causes most cervical cancers, have slashed cases and deaths in the United States. But poor countries can't afford those screening tools.</p><p>This study tried a test that costs very little and can be done by local people with just two weeks of training and no fancy lab equipment. They swab the cervix with diluted vinegar, which can make abnormal cells briefly change color.</p><p>This low-tech visual exam cut the cervical cancer death rate by 31 percent, the study found. It could prevent 22,000 deaths in India and 72,600 worldwide each year, researchers estimate.</p><p>""That's amazing. That's remarkable. It's a very exciting result,"" said Dr. Ted Trimble of the National Cancer Institute in the U.S., the main sponsor of the study.</p><p>The story of research participant Usha Devi is not an unusual one. Despite having given birth to four children, she had never had a gynecological exam. She had been bleeding heavily for several years, hoping patience and prayers would fix things.</p><p>""Everyone said it would go away, and every time I thought about going to the doctor there was either no money or something else would come up,"" she said, sitting in a tiny room that serves as bedroom, kitchen, bathroom and living room for her entire family.</p><p>One day she found a card from health workers trying to convince women to join the study. Devi is in her late 40s and like many poor Indians doesn't know her date of birth. She learned she had advanced cervical cancer. The study paid for surgery to remove her uterus and cervix.</p><p>The research effort was led by Dr. Surendra Shastri of Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. India has nearly one-third of the world's cases of cervical cancer — more than 140,000 each year.</p><p>""It's just not possible to provide Pap smear screening in developing countries. We don't have that kind of money"" or the staff or equipment, so a simpler method had to be found, Shastri said.</p><p>Starting in 1998, researchers enrolled 75,360 women to be screened every two years with the vinegar test. Another 76,178 women were chosen for a control, or comparison group that just got cancer education at the start of the study and vouchers for a free Pap test — if they could get to the hospital to have one. Women in either group found to have cancer were offered free treatment at the hospital.</p><p>Still, this quick and free cancer screening was a hard sell in a deeply conservative country where women are subservient and need permission from husbands, fathers or others for even routine decisions. Social workers were sent into the slums to win people over.</p><p>""We went to every single house in the neighborhood assigned to us introducing ourselves and asking them to come to our health talks. They used to come out of curiosity, listen to the talk but when we asked them to get screened they would totally refuse,"" said one social worker, Vaishnavi Bhagat. ""The women were both scared and shy.""</p><p>One woman who did agree to testing jumped up from the table when she was examined with a speculum. ""She started screaming that we had stolen her kidney,"" Bhagat said. Another health worker was beaten by people in the neighborhood when women realized they would have to disrobe to be screened.</p><p>""There was a sense of shame about taking their clothes off. A lot of them had their babies at home and had never been to a doctor,"" said one health worker, Urmila Hadkar. ""Sometimes just the idea of getting tested for cancer scared them. They would start crying even before being tested.""</p><p>But screening worked. The quality of screening by health workers was comparable to that of an expert gynecologist, researchers reported. The study was planned for 16 years, but results at 12 years showed lives were saved with the screening. So independent monitors advised offering it to the women in the comparison group.</p><p>An ethics controversy developed during the study. The U.S. Office for Human Research Protections faulted researchers for not adequately informing participants in the comparison group about Pap tests for screening. A letter from the agency in March indicated officials seemed to accept many of the remedies study leaders had implemented.</p><p>""We looked at the ethics very carefully"" and felt them to be sound, and visited the project in India, said Trimble of the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>Dr. Sandra Swain, a cancer specialist at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, also defended the research. She is president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, and the research results were presented at that group's meeting in Chicago on Sunday.</p><p>""There really was no wrongdoing there,"" she said. ""They have no screening anyway,"" so there is no standard of care now.</p><p>Officials in India already are making plans to expand the vinegar testing to a wider population.</p><p>Many poor countries can't afford mammograms for breast cancer screening either.

"The story of the Corinth camp , where thousands of slaves found freedom - and .",Grant's Contraband Conundrum - NYTimes.com,"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.</p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them ""contrabands of war.""</p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, ""Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time."" Within weeks hundreds of ""contrabands"" — men, women and children — flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.</p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were ""captives of war"" and would be set free.</p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.</p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. ""You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,"" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands ""will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.""</p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. ""There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,"" wrote one observer. ""Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.""</p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work ""organizing them into suitable companies for working."" A month later he went further. ""The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings"" — about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked — ""so far as practicable,"" he ordered. ""In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.""</p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, ""The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner."" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.</p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. ""When brought face to face with the slaves,"" she wrote, ""it was like the discovery of a new race."" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. ""You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,"" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. ""We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books."" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.</p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds ""saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen.

Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.</p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were ""captives of war"" and would be set free.</p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps.

""Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.""</p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work ""organizing them into suitable companies for working."" A month later he went further. ""The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings"" — about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked — ""so far as practicable,"" he ordered. ""In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.""</p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, ""The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner.""

Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. ""When brought face to face with the slaves,"" she wrote, ""it was like the discovery of a new race."" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. ""You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,"" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. ""We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books."" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school.

"the population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000 , as large groups undertook assignments for the heels of formal education . the earnestness in reference to the christian life that i have seldom seen .",Grant's Contraband Conundrum - NYTimes.com,"Disunion follows the Civil War as it unfolded.</p><p>The Lincoln administration may not have gone to war in 1861 to end slavery, but no one bothered to tell that to the slaves. Within six weeks of the firing on Fort Sumter, Gen. Benjamin Butler was forced to decide what to do with three slaves who escaped to Fortress Monroe on the north shore of Virginia's James River. Butler, certainly no abolitionist, nonetheless refused to return the three to their owner, labeling them ""contrabands of war.""</p><p>The term, suitably ambiguous for an administration that as yet had no policy on how to handle the fugitives, found immediate acceptance. As one Union officer wrote, ""Never was a word so speedily adopted by so many people in so short a time."" Within weeks hundreds of ""contrabands"" — men, women and children — flocked to Fortress Monroe and other Union Army positions. Unsure what might greet them, the escaped slaves were yet confident that life under federal control must surely represent an improvement.</p><p>It took the federal government more than a year to devise a policy in answer to this thirst for freedom. In August 1861, the First Confiscation Act stripped slaveholders of their claim of ownership, but it failed to clarify whether the slaves were themselves free. The following March Congress prohibited the military from sending escaped slaves back into slavery, and in July the Second Confiscation Act decreed that all slaves that took refuge in Union areas were ""captives of war"" and would be set free.</p><p>These legislative actions took on ever greater significance as Union forces moved deeper and deeper into Confederate territory. The growing number of contrabands reaching federal lines necessitated the establishment of dozens of impromptu contraband camps. A draft map compiled by the National Park Service illustrates how the network of these generally transitory camps mirrored the advance of the Union Army along the Mississippi, Tennessee and Cumberland River systems. Grant's Army of the Tennessee spent the summer of 1862 protecting supply lines in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi. Victories at the Battle of Iuka in September and the Battle of Corinth in early October solidified Union control of the area.</p><p>Lincoln's announcement of the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on Sept. 22, 1862, produced an even greater flood of refugees. How best to use and care for these contrabands proved particularly vexing for military leaders under Grant's command. ""You have no idea of the consternation Old Abe's Proclamation is making,"" wrote Gen. Grenville Dodge to his brother in September. The contrabands ""will not even wait until 1st January. I do not know what we shall do with them.""</p><p>Many of these fugitives arrived in an appalling condition. ""There were men, women, and children in every stage of disease or decrepitude often nearly naked, with flesh torn by the terrible experiences of their escape,"" wrote one observer. ""Often the slaves met prejudices against their color more bitter than any they had left behind.""</p><p>On Nov. 11, 1862, Grant took the first step toward addressing the crisis: he named John Eaton, a former high school principal and chaplain of the 27th Ohio Infantry, as superintendent of contrabands and set him at work ""organizing them into suitable companies for working."" A month later he went further. ""The negroes will be clothed, and in every way provided for, out of their earnings"" — about 12.5 cents for each pound of cotton picked — ""so far as practicable,"" he ordered. ""In no case will negroes be forced into the service of the Government, or be enticed away from their homes except when it becomes a military necessity.""</p><p>Grant's policies lent the contraband camps an official status and began to define what a freedman could and could not do once within the Union lines. Personally, Grant appears to have had no particular sympathy for the refugees. He seems to have recognized that, in the words of one observer, ""The soldiers of our army were a good deal opposed to serving the Negro in any manner."" Nevertheless, the Union commander unreservedly supported Eaton's work and in the process enabled the creation of one of the war's most successful contraband camps, located at Corinth, Miss.</p><p>Although formally organized under the direction of General Dodge in early December 1862 and placed under the command of James M. Alexander, chaplain of the 66th Illinois, the Corinth camp likely came into existence as early as September. Initially housed in army tents no longer considered serviceable for Union troops, the freedmen were soon set to work downing trees and clearing land on which to build cabins and lay out streets, which were named for Union generals. Eventually the freedmen also built a four-room school, a commissary, a hospital, a church and an office. The entire camp was divided into wards, complete with ward masters and a police force.</p><p>In late 1862 the American Missionary Association sent its first volunteers to Corinth to help care for, educate and minister to the freedmen. In a memoir written years after the war, one such missionary recalled her experience. ""When brought face to face with the slaves,"" she wrote, ""it was like the discovery of a new race."" The men and women who came to Corinth generally shared a paternalistic optimism and viewed the freedmen as childlike in their enthusiasm for both education and salvation.</p><p>The freedmen's thirst for knowledge was undeniable. ""You will find them every hour of daylight, at their books,"" observed the Rev. Edward Pierce in March of 1863. ""We cannot enter a cabin, or tent, but that we see from one to three with books."" Within no time Pierce and his wife had more than 150 students, and by the end of the summer, the addition of more missionaries enabled the school to accommodate between 300 and 400 children as well as 60 adults at a night school. In August, one of the teachers estimated that as many as 1,000 freedmen had learned to read in the Corinth camp.</p><p>Organized religion followed closely on the heels of formal education. Reverend Olds ""saw an earnestness in reference to the Christian life that I have seldom seen. And as I saw their deep earnestness & heard their hearty responses,"" he said, ""I was led to ask where can we find a more impressible people than these?""</p><p>The population of the camp fluctuated between 1,500 and 6,000, as large groups undertook assignments for the Union Army or contracted to work on local plantations. In March 1863, for example, the camp was home to 658 men, 1,440 women and 1,559 children. Among the men were 36 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 180 teamsters and 200 cooks. The female ranks included 80 seamstresses, 150 laundresses and 600 cooks. Two-thirds of the men and three-quarters of the women were married, and seven in eight women had children. According to John Eaton's records, the camp had experienced 900 cases of illness, 189 deaths and 45 births.</p><p>Life at Corinth changed dramatically after a May 1863 visit by Adj. Gen. Lorenzo Thomas, who was intent on recruiting thousands of contrabands for his newly formed black regiments. With the organization of the 1st Alabama Infantry of African Descent, later renamed the 55th United States Colored Troops, the camp lost most of its able-bodied men.</p><p>Their departure to fight left only the women, the young, the old and the infirm to carry on Eaton's ambitious agricultural program, which rested on the cooperative farming of large tracts of abandoned and confiscated land. The program put 400 acres under cultivation, 300 for cotton and 100 for vegetables. Each cabin also had its own subsistence garden. By May 1863, the success of the agricultural program and the presence of a multitude of skilled artisans produced a clear monthly profit of $4,000 to $5,000 for the government, as well as an admirably independent community that Eaton hoped might serve as a model for other camps.</p><p>Unfortunately, the success of the Corinth camp proved short-lived. Plans for a winter campaign by Union forces in January 1864 provided a grim reminder that the fate of the freedmen was always secondary to the triumph of the Union cause. The order to relocate the camp's inhabitants 93 miles westward, to Memphis, ""fell like a bomb-shell among our contented people,"" lamented one missionary, ""but military orders are preemptory,"" and they ""must be obeyed."" The freedmen left their ""well-organized village,"" gardens and farms to tdiv></p><p>The move from Corinth destroyed the spirit that had animated the freedmen's success. Some of the new refugees found work on confiscated plantations or in Memphis, but most lived in one of several camps surrounding the city.</p><p>""The destruction of the Corinth camp,"" noted one historian, ""was one of the tragedies of the Civil War."" Eaton's plan for large-scale cooperative farming fell victim to a bitter struggle between the War and Treasury departments over the leasing of plantations and was never implemented elsewhere. And no more than one or two other camps were able to replicate the strong civilian leadership, well-planned and policed living environment, and emphasis on education that made Corinth a success.</p><p>Had the government learned from the model fashioned in northern Mississippi between the fall of 1862 and early 1864, the newly freed slaves might well have enjoyed a far easier transition to life in postwar America.</p><p>Sources: Joseph E.

Sharapova, as she has done now in her past 18 three-setters on clay (and 25 of 26 overall), was too strong of mind and body over the longer distance, taking a tick over two hours to win 1-6, 7-5, 6-1.</p><p>So the tournament gets the glamour semi-final it craved: Sharapova, thrashed by Williams in last year's final, against the rising Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who had a marginally tougher time of it on Court Suzanne Lenglen.

However, Muguruza's tennis disintegrated into shards of overcooked groundstrokes as the fist-pumping diva at the other end again dipped into her considerable reserves of determination.</p><p>On Lenglen shortly afterwards, Bouchard hit a double fault on match point but repaired the damage with a stunning cross-court backhand and tried again.

If they are to break through when it matters, though, they will have to cope with the added pressure of expectation.

However, Muguruza's tennis disintegrated into shards of overcooked groundstrokes as the fist-pumping diva at the other end again dipped into her considerable reserves of determination.</p><p>On Lenglen shortly afterwards, Bouchard hit a double fault on match point but repaired the damage with a stunning cross-court backhand and tried again. As with Muguruza, Suárez Navarro left the stage with a limp, netted backhand, struck single-handedly. Both are interesting players with big games. If they are to break through when it matters, though, they will have to cope with the added pressure of expectation. Bouchard has taken just 10 games off Sharapova in 30, baggage that will be hard to carry into the first semi-final. But, like Muguruza, she has nothing to lose.</p><p>Sharapova had difficulty later understanding a tweet by Andy Murray's mother, Judy, and swore she had no idea who she was. The tweet was simple and clever – ""Sharapova is like a tea bag. Put her into hot water, and ul find out how strong she is"" – but the player looked nonplussed.</p><p>And when Sharapova was reminded of a photo of her with Bouchard as a young girl, currently hitting the airwaves on Twitter, she struggled to recall the moment.

She is not big on jokes and sentiment.</p><p>The women nevertheless outshone the men on day 10, although Ernests Gulbis sustained his eye-catching run with a stylish, serve-led demolition of Tomas Berdych that will give the world No2 Novak Djokovic plenty to ponder before their semi-final on Thursday.</p><p>On a buzzing Lenglen court, Gulbis, by a little way the most intriguing figure in the men's game, with talent to back his candour, allowed himself a lightbulb smile when Berdych stuck his closing effort into the netting.</p><p>Coming off the best result of his wayward career – over Roger Federer in five sets on Sunday – he showed he had plenty left in his some times unreliable legs to win 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, in three minutes less than it took Sharapova to beat Muguruza. won his match 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, but Djokovic made much harder work of beating Milos Raonic, who fought hard all the way to the end of the first two sets then launched a late fightback from 1-5 in the third before the Serb closed it out on his own serve, 7-5, 7-6, 6-4.</p><p>It might well have sounded absurd to say Gulbis would be a credible challenger for this title after he lost his first set of the tournament, 4-6 against the world No63 Lukasz Kubot.

Fuel Tech stumbled last summer when the U.S. District Court of Appeals vacated the Environmental Protection Agency's rule spelling out timetables for NOX reduction across the eastern half of the U.S. In a surprise move the same Court of Appeals reinstated the Clean Air Interstate Rule in December, and it went into effect on Jan. 1 as originally scheduled. Fuel Tech also sells chemicals that are tossed into a coal burner to fight slag and thereby boost power plant efficiency. The company generates most of its revenue in the U.S., but management is looking to expand in emerging markets like China and eastern Europe, where pollution-control technology is still quite new.</p><p>Fuel Tech shares look expensive at 78 times my earnings projection of 15 cents a share for the 12 months beginning in July, but I expect rapid growth. It is reasonable to expect earnings of 60 cents a share in 2010.</p><p>President Obama's proposed focus on cybersecurity will benefit ArcSight ( ARST - news - people )(ARST, 17). ArcSight's software collects and correlates user activity and event data across an enterprise so that businesses can rapidly identify and respond to compliance violations, policy breaches, cyberattacks and insider threats. For example, if a user is logged in to the network from home and subsequently tries to enter the office by scanning his badge at the entrance, an alert is issued.</p><p>ArcSight's software was developed for the government, and its client list boasts 20 federal agencies. Corporations are adopting ArcSight to comply with data-security provisions of such laws as Sarbanes-Oxley and the health care privacy paperwork statute that goes by the acronym HIPAA. Shares trade for 31 times my earnings estimate of 55 cents for the 12 months ending April 2010.</p><p>Investing with the tides of legislative change has its perils. The rules of the game can change quickly, and budgets can be changed at the whim of the elected. The four companies I mention above have technologies that are effective on their own merits and are poised to benefit from the way the political winds are blowing now.</p><p>Jim Oberweis is president of Oberweis Asset Management and editor of the Oberweis Report.

The very mention of his name (he was prominent during the Monica Lewinsky scandal) lends a whiff of skulduggery to any situation.</p><p>But injecting Blumenthal as a central character in the Benghazi probe doesn't help Republicans demonstrate that Clinton did wrong. And the justification for invoking him — to demonstrate that Clinton had more contact with him than with Stevens — is a stretch. Whatever else one thinks of the former journalist — I've clashed with him over the years — he had nothing to do with what happened in Libya on Sept. 11 and 12, 2012.</p><p>Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan.) acted as if he had found a video of Blumenthal attacking the compound himself. Pompeo, who had previously made the false allegation that Clinton got ""most of her intelligence"" on Libya from Blumenthal, asked whether Stevens had Clinton's personal e-mail, her cellphone number, fax or home address or visited her at home. ""Mr. Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things,"" Pompeo concluded.</p><p>Rep. Peter J. Roskam (R-Ill.) thought he saw a smoking gun in an e-mail correspondence from August 2011 in which Blumenthal encouraged Clinton to ""make a public statement before the cameras"" when Libyan leader Moammar Gaddafi was deposed.</p><p>""Two months before the end of the Gaddafi regime and you're already planning on how to make your statement dramatic to maximize political gain,"" Roskam scolded.</p><p>Relevance to the Benghazi attack? None.</p><p>Gowdy, for his part, found it damning that Clinton aides passed along some of Blumenthal's advice (which he got from a former intelligence official) to people including Stevens. ""It's relevant because our ambassador was asked to read and respond to Sidney Blumenthal's drivel,"" the chairman said, ""in some instances on the very same day he was asking for security.""</p><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), a Democrat, observed that for all the time the panel has spent on Blumenthal, you'd think ""that he was in Benghazi on the night, manning the barricades."" During private testimony from Blumenthal, to which he was summoned by federal marshals, Republicans asked more than 160 questions about Blumenthal's associations with Bill and Hillary Clinton but fewer than 20 about the Benghazi attacks.</p><p>Schiff and Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (Md.), the ranking Democrat, proposed that Republicans, rather than selectively releasing Blumenthal's e-mails, come clean about their interest in him and make public the entire transcript of his testimony. Gowdy, after a shouting match with Cummings, refused.</p><p>Read more from Dana Milbank's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.",2,3,4,3

The vacuum of power within the Republican Party could him to run for president a third time .,Can't quit Mitt: Friends say Romney feels nudge to consider a 2016 presidential run,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Officially, Mitt Romney returned to Iowa, the quadrennial presidential proving ground, to give a boost to Joni Ernst. But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.</p><p>""When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,"" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.</p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.</p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, ""If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better."" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, ""Run, Mitt, run!""</p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate. He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time. But his friends said a flurry of behind-the-scenes activity is nudging him to more seriously consider it.</p><p>Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is hitting the stump for Republicans this fall -- which reminded us of some of his most memorable moments during the 2012 campaign. Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)</p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?</p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.</p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.</p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.</p><p>""There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,"" Pawlenty said. ""If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.""</p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt ""and was stronger for it."" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, ""the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.""</p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.</p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues. When reporters tried to question him afterward, he sneaked into a dark maze of cubicles.</p><p>He also said that now that he was no longer a candidate, he had a joke to share involving Obama, golfer Phil Mickelson and tennis great Andre Agassi.</p><p>As Romney told it, Obama shows up at a bank to cash a check without his ID. The teller asks him to prove who he is, saying that Mickelson proved his identity by hitting a golf ball into a cup and Agassi proved his by hitting a tennis ball at a target. ""Is there anything you can do to prove who you are?"" the teller asks.</p><p>""I don't have a clue,"" Obama replies in the joke.</p><p>The crowd ate it up.</p><p>Former aides and senior Republicans say Romney appreciates the GOP masses crowing that he was right about issues such as Russia and health care. But what really intrigues him, they said, are the vulnerabilities among top-tier candidates in the Republican field. If Romney moves toward a race, it would be because he sees a path to victory.</p><p>""It's the market pulling him,"" said Kent Lucken, a longtime friend and adviser who accompanied Romney to Iowa. ""People look at Hillary as the likely Democratic nominee, and the party needs a strong leader who can stand up to her and who's been through the process.""</p><p>Romney is returning to Boston on Tuesday for a dinner that he and his wife, Ann, are hosting for former campaign advisers and business associates. The event — to benefit neurological research at Brigham and Women's Hospital — has Romney intimates abuzz.</p><p>Save-the-date notices have gone out for the third annual Romney policy retreat in Park City, Utah, in June 2015 — a signal that he wants a platform to promote his issues as the presidential primary campaign season gets underway.</p><p>Romney is also mingling privately with top donors who could fund a third campaign. Romney visited Sept. 23 with Joe Ricketts, a billionaire investor who finances the Ending Spending super PAC, at Ricketts's palatial penthouse apartment covering the entire 78th floor of the Time Warner Center in New York.</p><p>On Oct. 6, Romney also took part in a GOP fundraising dinner at the Manhattan apartment of Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner and former Romney campaign finance chairman. Several 2016 hopefuls gave presentations to the donors, while Romney served as a co-host and made no pitch.</p><p>At Johnson's home, Romney and media magnate Rupert Murdoch spoke about Romney's political future. According to two Romney allies familiar with the conversation, Romney was cagey with Murdoch but expressed concerns about the developing GOP field. Romney told Murdoch that he felt uneasy about the party's non-interventionist drift on foreign policy and the base's embrace of ideological hard-liners.</p><p>Many Romney boosters believe that his window of opportunity will be in mid- to late 2015, should Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) or Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) ascend and party establishment types turn to Romney as a savior.</p><p>If former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) opts out of a campaign, ""there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go,"" said Tom Rath, an influential New Hampshire Republican.</p><p>At a luncheon this month in Atlanta to help GOP Senate nominee David Perdue, ""people sat up and paid attention"" to Romney, said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.). ""I pulled him aside afterward to thank him for coming. He said he's not running, and I take him at his word. But I don't think the door is entirely closed, and circumstances can change.""</p><p>That phrase — ""circumstances can change"" — has been repeated by many Romney backers since the former nominee used it to describe his own thinking about 2016 in a radio interview last month with Hugh Hewitt.</p><p>Spencer Zwick, Romney's former national finance chairman, talks regularly with Romney and said he has been receiving daily calls from donors and other supporters. ""There are still plenty of donors who hope circumstances will change and there will be an opportunity for Romney to run again,"" he said.</p><p>Zwick is part of a slimmed-down inner circle, including longtime advisers Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty, Stuart Stevens, Lanhee Chen and aides Kelli Harrison and Matt Waldrip, who are advising Romney on political activities this fall.</p><p>Romney traveled through Iowa with three trusted advisers and friends: David Kochel, Ron Kaufman and Lucken. He also reunited with supporters from campaigns past.

"If former Florida governor Jeb Bush ( R ) opts out of a campaign , '' there is going to be more pressure on Mitt to go , '' said Tom Rath , an influential New Hampshire Republican .",Can't quit Mitt: Friends say Romney feels nudge to consider a 2016 presidential run,"CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Officially, Mitt Romney returned to Iowa, the quadrennial presidential proving ground, to give a boost to Joni Ernst. But at a closed-door breakfast fundraiser here Monday, the first question from a donor had nothing to do with Ernst's Senate campaign.</p><p>""When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,"" a donor told Ernst, according to several attendees. The Republican candidate said she would, while Romney laughed.</p><p>When Romney and Ernst gathered in a West Des Moines boardroom with about 40 agriculture executives Sunday night, one businessman after another pleaded with Romney to give the White House another shot.</p><p>And at a rally for Ernst in Cedar Rapids on Monday, the state legislator who introduced Romney said, ""If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better."" After Romney and Ernst finished speaking, some activists chanted, ""Run, Mitt, run!""</p><p>Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee and now the tacit head of the Republican Party, visited Iowa as part of a feverish nationwide tour designed to help the GOP take control of the Senate. He has insisted that he is not interested in running for president a third time.

Here's a look at some of Romney's worst gaffes and a few predictions he got right. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post)</p><p>Romney has huddled with prominent donors and reconnected with supporters in key states in recent months. Because of the vacuum of power within his party and the lack of a clear 2016 front-runner, confidants said Romney is grappling with this question: If drafted, would he answer the party's call?</p><p>Further juicing the speculation was a Des Moines Register-Bloomberg News poll released over the weekend showing that Romney is the only potential 2016 candidate who would beat Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) among likely Iowa voters, 44 percent to 43 percent.</p><p>People in Romney's vast political orbit who are waiting and wishing on him to launch another campaign said Romney has done little to quiet them and has been hazy about his plans following next month's midterm elections.</p><p>Former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty (R), who briefly ran against Romney in 2012 before becoming a close ally, said he wants to see Romney give it another go.</p><p>""There is a feeling that the country missed out on an exceptional president,"" Pawlenty said. ""If he runs, I believe he could win the nomination and the general election. It'd be the right person at the right time, and I would encourage him to do it.""</p><p>Pawlenty noted that Ronald Reagan ran unsuccessfully for president twice before being elected in his third attempt ""and was stronger for it."" In contrast with Romney, Pawlenty said, ""the emerging class of Republican candidates is untested and unproven.""</p><p>Within Romney's political network, there has been informal chatter about a third run since early 2013, according to people familiar with the discussions. It bubbled up in phone calls and at dinners and has gained steam this year. Requests continue to pour in for him to appear on the campaign trail, and advisers said he is eager to mount a multi-state fly-around swing before Nov. 4.</p><p>In Iowa, however, Romney seemed uncomfortable with the 2016 talk. At the West Des Moines rally, he spoke for only five minutes, criticizing President Obama on income inequality, foreign affairs and other issues.
